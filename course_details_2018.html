						<h3>overview</h3>
						<p>Many cities around the world are now declaring themselves as “Smart Cities”, collecting data in digital form and using that data to manage assets, resources, and people. Brisbane has a vision to become a smart city. That vision is motivated by: attracting and retaining business, attracting people with the skills to support business, and making the city more efficient and environmentally friendly.</p>
						<p>There is another view of a smart city, one that increases the focus on people and citizens who live in that city. In that vision “urban citizens” are engaged and empowered to act, addressing problems that they think are important to their lives.</p>
						<p>The focus of this course is to explore how this alternative view of a smart city can be made a reality through technology that aims to strengthen the social fabric of the UQ community.</p>
						<p>Our starting point is conducting <mark>design research</mark> using a range of methods to gather information and then use that information as part of a design process. where we need to identify some of those needs and explore how technology might support those needs.  Our next stage is to create a <mark>proposal</mark>.  To create that proposal we will use the information that we have gathered from the design research we have completed as well additional information that we will gather by: constructing a medium fidelity prototype and evaluating that prototype at a showcase.</p>
						<p>At this point, we will create a report suited for submission to <a href="https://chi2019.acm.org/authors/student-design-competition/">the CHI 2019 Student Design Competition</a>.</p>
						<p>In January, we will develop a <mark>high fidelity prototype</mark>.  Again, we will use a number of methods to evaluate those prototypes though a further showcase of the technology that we have developed.  Finally we will create a <mark>working project</mark> and install that project in a space at UQ.  The working project will then be evaluated in situ.</p>

						<h3>aims of the project</h3>
						<p>It is expected that upon successful completion of the course, you will demonstrate knowledge, understanding and/or skills in:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>people-centred design and development processes; </li>
							<li>conducting people-centred design research; </li>
							<li>design and development of technological applications fitting within the domain of citizen-centric smart cities;</li>
							<li>Use a range of interaction design methods which involve the people from target user groups – such as ethnography, contextual design, interviews, and surveys – in the process of interactive system design; </li>
							<li>Apply iterative design techniques such as scenario development, prototyping, and participatory design in the design of an interactive system; </li>
							<li>Understand the role of evaluation (user and expert) in the development of interactive systems, implement an evaluation framework that is appropriate for a given set of objectives, analyse the results of those evaluation methods in terms of establishing design and system requirements, and report those results and analysis; and,</li>
							<li>reporting research outcomes, on the basis of successfully completing a design research project in a specific area</li>

						<h3>learning activities</h3>
						<p>These are the learning activities for this course.  Details of the tasks to be completed for each activity will be provided progressively throughout the course.  Given this is an open design process, there may need to be some changes to the actual design process that is followed in order to respond to the conditions and needs that are uncovered by that design process.</p>
						<p>Further details for each of the activity weeks is available on this site.  Please ensure that you refer to those pages as the information on this page is only an overview of the tasks to be completed.</p>

Students are expected to interact and discuss in feedback or critique sessions and in working on projects.  Where designated, participation will include contribution through online forums or other mechanisms.</p>

								<p class="card-text">The aim of this post is to: explore the design space relevant to the project to find existing projects, applications or installations that will give you inspiration, and to help you understand how to use these existing projects to give you insights that will help inform your design decisions.</p>
								<p class="card-text">Do an online search to find a report or website that reports on an existing installation or application that has been created for either a smart city or a garden/community garden.  Ensure that the report/website includes some information about the aims of the installation and some background to the design decisions that were made.  Extend your search to see if you can find any additional comments about that installation/application.</p>
								<p class="card-text">Write blog post that is an analysis of that installation or application considering how its design is relevant to this project.  Your post should include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A very brief explanation of the installation including references/links to your sources of information</li>
									<li>An overview of one or two of the key design decisions that were made including some explanation of the designer’s rationale</li>
									<li>Your insights from the installation - what was important/interesting/significant and why (especially consider the human values that these insights are either attempting to support or might be undermining)</li>
									<li>An explanation of how these insights might be relevant to this project</li>
