						<h3>overview</h3>
						<p>Many cities around the world are now declaring themselves as “Smart Cities”, collecting data in digital form and using that data to manage assets, resources, and people. Brisbane has a vision to become a smart city. That vision is motivated by: attracting and retaining business, attracting people with the skills to support business, and making the city more efficient and environmentally friendly.</p>
						<p>There is another view of a smart city, one that increases the focus on people and citizens who live in that city. In that vision “urban citizens” are engaged and empowered to act, addressing problems that they think are important to their lives.</p>
						<p>The focus of this course is to explore how this alternative view of a smart city can be made a reality through technology that aims to strengthen the social fabric of the UQ community.</p>
						<p>Our starting point is conducting <mark>design research</mark> using a range of methods to gather information and then use that information as part of a design process. where we need to identify some of those needs and explore how technology might support those needs.  Our next stage is to create a <mark>proposal</mark>.  To create that proposal we will use the information that we have gathered from the design research we have completed as well additional information that we will gather by: constructing a medium fidelity prototype and evaluating that prototype at a showcase.</p>
						<p>At this point, we will create a report suited for submission to <a href="https://chi2019.acm.org/authors/student-design-competition/">the CHI 2019 Student Design Competition</a>.</p>
						<p>In January, we will develop a <mark>high fidelity prototype</mark>.  Again, we will use a number of methods to evaluate those prototypes though a further showcase of the technology that we have developed.  Finally we will create a <mark>working project</mark> and install that project in a space at UQ.  The working project will then be evaluated in situ.</p>

						<h3>aims of the project</h3>
						<p>It is expected that upon successful completion of the course, you will demonstrate knowledge, understanding and/or skills in:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>people-centred design and development processes; </li>
							<li>conducting people-centred design research; </li>
							<li>design and development of technological applications fitting within the domain of citizen-centric smart cities;</li>
							<li>Use a range of interaction design methods which involve the people from target user groups – such as ethnography, contextual design, interviews, and surveys – in the process of interactive system design; </li>
							<li>Apply iterative design techniques such as scenario development, prototyping, and participatory design in the design of an interactive system; </li>
							<li>Understand the role of evaluation (user and expert) in the development of interactive systems, implement an evaluation framework that is appropriate for a given set of objectives, analyse the results of those evaluation methods in terms of establishing design and system requirements, and report those results and analysis; and,</li>
							<li>reporting research outcomes, on the basis of successfully completing a design research project in a specific area</li>

						<p>These are the learning activities for this course.  Details of the tasks to be completed for each activity will be provided progressively throughout the course.  Given this is an open design process, there may need to be some changes to the actual design process that is followed in order to respond to the conditions and needs that are uncovered by that design process.</p>
						<p>Further details for each of the activity weeks is available on this site.  Please ensure that you refer to those pages as the information on this page is only an overview of the tasks to be completed.</p>

								<h4>#1 design space survey & how to use what you find</h4>
							</div>
								<div class="card-body">
								<h5 class="card-title">Set: 7dec | Due: 12dec</h5>
								<p class="card-text">The aim of this post is to: explore the design space relevant to the project to find existing projects, applications or installations that will give you inspiration, and to help you understand how to use these existing projects to give you insights that will help inform your design decisions.</p>
								<p class="card-text">Do an online search to find a report or website that reports on an existing installation or application that has been created for either a smart city or a garden/community garden.  Ensure that the report/website includes some information about the aims of the installation and some background to the design decisions that were made.  Extend your search to see if you can find any additional comments about that installation/application.</p>
								<p class="card-text">Write blog post that is an analysis of that installation or application considering how its design is relevant to this project.  Your post should include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A very brief explanation of the installation including references/links to your sources of information</li>
									<li>An overview of one or two of the key design decisions that were made including some explanation of the designer’s rationale</li>
									<li>Your insights from the installation - what was important/interesting/significant and why (especially consider the human values that these insights are either attempting to support or might be undermining)</li>
									<li>An explanation of how these insights might be relevant to this project</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="text-info">Whilst the actual post is not due until Tuesday 12 December, please be ready on Monday to talk about the things you would include in your blog post.  There will be opportunity on Monday to explore your thoughts and get feedback before you finalise your blog post.</p>

								<h4>#2 human values and your technology probe</h4>
							</div>
								<div class="card-body">
								<h5 class="card-title">Set: 23Jan | Due: 29Jan</h5>
								<p class="card-text">The aim of this post is to: explain what you hope to learn from your technology probe.</p>
								<p class="card-text">Hutchinson et al (2003) from our readings provides a neat summary of what they consider can be learned by building and deploying a technology probe:</p>
								<blockquote class="blockquote">
									<p class="card-text">Technology probes are simple, flexible, adaptable technologies with three interdisciplinary goals: the social science goal of understanding the needs and desires of users in a real-world setting, the engineering goal of field testing the technology, and the design goal of inspiring users and researchers to think about new technologies.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p class="text-info">This article is available in the course readings</p>
								<p class="card-text">Now that your technology probe is getting close to a final form and you have a better idea of how it works and what it will look like when in place, we want you to consider (and explain) what information you hope your technology probe will help you gather.  Our project has a starting position, where we sought to design for a citizen centric smart city.  From there, we needed to find out what were people's needs and what were their views on technology.  As we get ready to deploy our projects into a garden, we must also remind ourselves that technology has politics and (despite what many say) is not neutral.  So what might this mean?</p>
								<p class="text-info">You might want to refresh your memories about the politics of technology and artefacts: <a href="http://innovate.ucsb.edu/463-langdon-winner-do-artifacts-have-politics" target="_blank">read this very quick summary and the article that it is linked to</a></p>

								<h4>#3 evaluating</h4>
							</div>
								<div class="card-body">
								<h5 class="card-title">Set: 29Jan | Due: 5 Feb</h5>
								<p class="card-text">The aim of this post is to: explain the evaluation of your proposed application.</p>
								<p class="text-info">As background to this blog post, read Case Study 2 <span class="font-italic">The Clouds and the Twinkly Lights Project</span> in the book <span class="font-weight-bold">Research in the Wild</span> by Rogers, Marshall and Carroll (2017).  This book is available online through the UQ library.</p>
								<p class="card-text">As you read this case study, look for how they evaluated the project. What sort of data did they seek to collect? What did they look for?  What issues did they try to address in their data collection?  What did they have to do given it was an <span class="font-italic">in situ</span> study?</p>
								<p class="card-text">Given a key focus of your project was supporting specific human values that you identified during the design phase <span class="font-weight-bold">and</span> the values of a citizen centric smart city, what should you be looking for as you analyse the information you obtain from your evaluation?</p>

								<h4>#4 reflection</h4>
							</div>
								<div class="card-body">
								<h5 class="card-title">Set: 6 Feb | Due: 9 Feb</h5>
								<p class="card-text">The aim of this post is for you to think back across the process you have followed and reflect on some aspect of the process that you felt was most valuable.</p>
								<p class="card-text">When creating a portfolio, most companies are not focused purely on what you have created or the end product.  What they are really wanting to see is the process that you have followed, the methods you have used and how you made decisions that you made.</p>
								<blockquote class="blockquote">
									<p class="card-text">Tell me what you made and why. Tell me how you got to this solution. Tell me what you learned. Show me where you are in the project. Show me the creative twist. Show me the point. If you can’t, leave the project out, no matter how pretty it is. Your portfolio should be yours. And if it’s truly yours, it will be materially and clearly different from every other portfolio, even if everyone’s using the same template.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p class="card-text">Start off this blog post by reading <span class="font-italic"><a href="https://deardesignstudent.com/the-myth-of-the-portfolio-piece-959b8737a1d7" target="_blank">The Myth of the Portfolio Piece</a></span> by Rachel Berger.</p>
								<p class="card-text">You already have created a lot of information about the project that you built. In this blog post, we want you to outline one step in the process or method that you used in the design and development process that you found most valuable in shaping your project.  Then write a blog post that provides explains to someone else who is just about to embark on a similar project, what is important about that step or method (your advice to them on how they should use that step or method) and why you found it so valuable for your project.  Make sure that you illustrate this post by specifically referring back to your step or process.</p>
