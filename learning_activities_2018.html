						<h3>week 1 - design research [iteration #1]</h3>
						<h4>Remote or flexible - completed at any time up to 7 December</h4>
						<p>As mentioned, it is recommended that students designate a week across which the tasks will be completed.  If students prefer, they may choose to complete this learning activity by attending at UQ from Monday 26 November to Thursday 29 November, 2018.</p>
						<p>Whilst these tasks must be completed by 7 December, it is important to note that the final element of these tasks is to provide critique on others video prototypes.  Therefore, all video prototypes must be added to the padlet (see below) no later than 5 December in order to allow sufficient time for critique to be completed and added.</p>
						<p>The tasks to be completed as part of this activity are:</p>

										<ol>
											<li>Robert G. Hollands (2015), Critical interventions into the corporate smart city, Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, volume 8, pp 61-77</li>

Go into this <a href="https://padletuq.padlet.org/p_worthy1/deco30007000_deskresearcharticles">padlet</a> and create a new post for each insight.  Add to that post, your thoughts on that insight.  These thoughts might be (but are not limited to) why you think that insight is relevant for the project or something that you think it is important for everyone involved to remember.  Please ensure that you include a clear explanation for your thoughts.</p>

										<p>Investigate a public place that is either at UQ or is similar to a place at UQ (for example, investigating an eatery similar to the Refec Precinct at UQ).  Spend time at that site (at least an hour, but preferably a few hours at different times of day).  Consider the features of the site and the people who use or travel through that site.</p>

Effectively, you need to present the site through photographs, descriptions of the people you observe using the site, their approximate demographics, time of day, behaviours and activities.  For each, add your thoughts on how you think these might be relevant for the project.</p>
