						<h3>week 1 - design research</h3>
						<h4>Remote or flexible - completed at any time up to 7 December</h4>
						<p>As mentioned, it is recommended that students designate a week across which the tasks will be completed.  If students prefer, they may choose to complete this learning activity by attending at UQ from Monday 26 November to Thursday 29 November, 2018.</p>
						<p>Whilst these tasks must be completed by 7 December, it is important to note that the final element of these tasks is to provide critique on others video prototypes.  Therefore, all video prototypes must be added to the padlet (see below) no later than 5 December in order to allow sufficient time for critique to be completed and added.</p>
						<p>The tasks to be completed as part of this activity are:</p>
						<table class="table table-striped pushdown5">
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th scope="col">Task</th>
									<th scope="col">Detail</th>
									<th scope="col">Deliverables</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<th scope="row">Desk Research - Problem Space</th>
									<td>
										<p>The aim of this task is to become familiar with the domain of citizen-centric smart cities and the issues that have been identified.  Read the following two articles (you can find these on Google Scholar and by using the UQ library databases):</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Robert G. Hollands (2015), Critical interventions into the corporate smart city, Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, volume 8, pp 61-77</li>
											<li>Laura Forlano (2016), Decentering the Human in the Design of Collaborative Cities, DesignIssues (MIT), Volume 32, Number 3, pp 42-54</li>
										</ol>
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>For each article, identify three insights that you think are important to the project.  Go into this <a href="https://padletuq.padlet.org/p_worthy1/deco30007000_deskresearcharticles">padlet</a> and create a new post for each insight.  Add to that post, your thoughts on that insight.  These thoughts might be (but are not limited to) why you think that insight is relevant for the project or something that you think it is important for everyone involved to remember.  Please ensure that you include a clear explanation for your thoughts.</p>
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th scope="row">Desk Research - Design Space</th>
									<td>
										<p>The aim of this task is to explore existing smart city technology that could be considered to be citizen-centric or has been designed to be citizen-centric.</p>
										<p>Find an example of citizen-centric smart city technology (Google scholar is a good place to start, but you should also search beyond academic research).  Critically review that technology</p>
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>Go into this <a href="https://padletuq.padlet.org/p_worthy1/deco30007000_designresearch_problemspace">padlet</a> and create a new post for the example technology that you have found.  Add to that post, your thoughts about that technology including (but not limited to): What makes it citizen-centric?  What needs is it seeking to address?  Who's needs are those?  What design features make it successful?  What could be improved?  What limitations are there?</p>
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th scope="row">Site Survey</th>
									<td>
										<p>The aim of this task is to consider and identify factors that might be relevant when selecting a site to install the technology that will be developed as part of this project.</p>
										<p>Investigate a public place that is either at UQ or is similar to a place at UQ (for example, investigating an eatery similar to the Refec Precinct at UQ).  Spend time at that site (at least an hour, but preferably a few hours at different times of day).  Consider the features of the site and the people who use or travel through that site.</p>
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>Go into this <a href="https://padletuq.padlet.org/p_worthy1/deco30007000_sitesurvey">padlet</a> and add the results of your site survey.  Create a new note for each of the different observations or notes that you take.  Effectively, you need to present the site through photographs, descriptions of the people you observe using the site, their approximate demographics, time of day, behaviours and activities.  For each, add your thoughts on how you think these might be relevant for the project.</p>
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th scope="row">Video prototype</th>
									<td>
										<p>The aim of this task is to create a concept of a technology that you think could be considered as citizen-centric at UQ.</p>
										<p>Your concept must take into account the results of the research that you have completed so far.</p>
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>Create a video that explains your concept.  This video may be an animation or a video of a demonstration of a low fidelity prototype (paper, cardboard, etc) that uses wizard of oz methods to explain the interaction.  Go into this <a href="https://padletuq.padlet.org/p_worthy1/deco30007000_videoprototype">padlet</a> and add a link to your video prototype.  Include an explanation of your rationale for the design of the prototype.</p>
									</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th scope="row">Critique of Video prototype</th>
									<td>
										<p>The aim of this task is to provide critique of others video prototypes.</p>
										<p>This critique should be provided with the intention of assisting to improve the proposed prototype.  Therefore it must be constructive, actionable and specific.</p>
									</td>
									<td>
										<p>View other's posts in the video prototype padlet.  Add your critique as comments to their posts in that padlet.  Provide critique on at least three other video prototypes.</p>
									</td>
