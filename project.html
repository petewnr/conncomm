					<h4>How do we design smart city technology so that is is citizen-centric?</h4>
					<p>UQ collects a range of data that is used for many purposes including planning for the delivery of services to those who visit and use the campus.  The focus of this course is to explore how this alternative view of a smart city can be made a reality through technology that aims to strengthen the social fabric of the UQ community.</p>

					<p>Many cities around the world are now declaring themselves as "Smart Cities".  On one definition:</p>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">
						<p class="mb-0 text-secondary font-italics">A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information used to manage assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services.</p>

				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>The Australian Government has a plan encouraging Australian cities to become smart cities and in 2016
conducted a consultation with the State and Local Governments about this plan. Brisbane has been involved with these consultations. Brisbane’s stated vision is consistent with what is happening else where in the world, where smart cities are being driven by three motivations:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>economics - attracting and retaining businesses and industry seen as being important</li>
						<li>population demographics - attracting people with the relevant skills to support businesses and industry</li>
						<li>sustainability - making the cities more efficient and environmentally friendly</li>
					</ul>
					<p>However there is another view of a smart city.  This view increases the focus on the people and citizens who live in those smart cities, where “urban citizens” are engaged and empowered to act to address problems that they think are important to improve their lives.</p>
					<p>To make this happen the technology must be understandable and usable, the data that is collected must
be accessible, and real value or benefit must be delivered to those citizen.</p>
					<p>The focus of this project is to explore how this alternative view of a smart city can be made a reality through technology.  The focus will be the UQ campus as a community, considering the range of people and communities that may form.  Through the use of data provided by UQ ITS we will create our own smart city technology that engages people in communities by making data visible and accessible.</p>
