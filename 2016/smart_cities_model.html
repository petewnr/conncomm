				<p>Figure 1 above represents our interpretation of how the development of a Smart City should function.  The model shows the evolution of a smart city that is difficult to define. It determines the character of the smart city in its current state of evolution.  The model allows the plan to show the flavour of the city – the specific focus of the plan and prioritizing major factors to give a flavour of the smart city.  Cities that have a focus on economy, technology, boosting the population, environment or better lifestyle are just some of the flavours we found in our studies.</p>
				<p>It is a cyclic diagram as these programs are developed in cycles of a certain number of years and are reviewed after that time.  Within the whole process there is a cyclic process of groups working collaboratively and constant reiteration of ideas and plans to instigate change and improvement.</p>
				<p>Some cities building on pre-existing structures and re-building a better place for all, while other cities are building from scratch and using capital and technology to build a new but better place. Cat Matson (2016) asks “What is a smart city?” and questions whether it is the lure of technology using highly efficient systems, fed by data to provide answers to many of the recent urban problems. Will it connect the people who live there or visit the city to the people, services and infrastructure to make their life better and easier.  The presumption is that a smart city is technology driven and will make life better for all and the reality is that this may not be the case.</p>
				<p>The model is based on four main factors that are all inter-related and must work together to end up with the outcomes of the plan – a Smart City.
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					  <li>Interest: need to know about something or someone or to build on what they have </li>
					  <li>Enabler: a person or thing that makes something possible</li>
					  <li>Drivers: People, knowledge or conditions that initiate and support activities for driving the Smart City plan</li>
					  <li>Strategy/Catalysts: a plan or person that precipitates an action of change.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>From our research each city has a different direction for their implementation of the Smart City plan. It is considered that the city implementing the plan will have at least three different driving interests in developing the Smart City plan.</p>
				<p>Figure 2 represents cities such as San Diego, Amsterdam and Barcelona have shown a responsibility to its people and by using smart technology, smart education and smart citizens are creating a bottom up approach to the creation of the smart city.  Decision making has been from all levels of the city and all feel as though they have ownership and part of these Smart cities. Their approach to the direction of process started with taking existing situations and obtaining information from all stakeholders, finding the enablers that are important and devising strategies or catalysts that are going to make these plans come to fruition.</p>
				<p>In contrast, Figure 3 shows the city of Songdo had a top down approach – putting technology in place to improve or create the outcomes of the plan.  In this approach the government and business were the drivers behind the strategies providing a technological advanced city that is to make life better for the people.  Songdo is a unique case in which the design and implementation was a very business centric approach with the main goal being profit. The main projects they finish such as golf courses, schools and other infrastructure is used to show case to people in order to entice potential workers to Songdo IBD.</p>
				<p>The model will work for any city that is trying to take on the mantle of being a Smart City.  The plan, being cyclic in nature demonstrates how all components need to work together to be a whole.  The differing nature of each Smart City will draw certain aspects of each component to have greater focus – a city such as Singapore whose main interest is in building a better human condition and improving the city’s economy has enabled technology funded by the government and business to create projects to build a better city for its people.</p>
