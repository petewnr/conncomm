				<h3>How does Songdo define itself as a smart city?</h3>
				<p>Songdo IBD was designed by the New York Office of Kohn Pederson Fox (KPF) as ubiquitous smart city. Ubiquitous, meaning “found everywhere”, refers to the technology found throughout the entire infrastructure.  Examples of this include residents of Songdo IBD being able to video conference one another and attend classes remotely using in-built systems. Residents can also control heating, lighting and air-conditioning through control panels. Sensors are implemented throughout Songdo IBD to gather data on things such as traffic flow, energy use and more. This technology is then processed so that residents can be alerted on when a bus will arrive, or even notify law enforcement when a crime is taking place.  </p>

				<h3>Who is driving the smart city movement?</h3>
				<p>Today’s Songdo is a result of a long-term public-private partnership. Since 2001, that partnership that undertaken the development of Songdo IBD – from the initial master planning and implementation of advanced infrastructure, to design and development in subsequent phases, and finally to the vitalization of the city. </p>

				<h3>Who is involved, and how?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>New York-based Gale International – Real Estate and City-Scale Development.</li>
					<li>Korea-based POSCO E&C – Indonesia integrated steel mill plant – construction focused.</li>
					<li>Public sector partner Incheon Metropolitan City. </li>

				<h3>Directive, Ownership and Goals</h3>
				
				<p>The Songdo International Business District is a planned city designed to facilitate global business. Recreational facilities like golf clubs will further improve the quality of life in the Songdo International Business District. It will greatly contribute to attracting more international businessmen and investors to this city as their destination of choice. --<a href="http://jacknicklausgolfclubkorea.com/eng/pages/about/songdo_ibd.asp">The Jack Nicklaus Golf Club</a></p>

				<p>Gale International, holds a majority stake of 61%, Posco 30%, and the remaining 9% is owned by Morgan Stanley Real Estate. The plan was designed by the New York office of Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF). Infrastructure development, labor, and funding are also being provided by the city of Incheon. --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songdo_International_Business_District">Wiki</a></p>

				<p>Since Songdo IBD is actually privately owned with the majority of the shares owned by a New York based business, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the motivations are to promote wealth. Profit for the developers by having more residents and businesses paying for the infrastructure, more wealth for Korea by collecting taxes, more wealth for businesses by having a central hub and more wealth for the individual person by being employed by the businesses being there.</p>

				<p>There also seems to be a general theme of "innovation" present in Songdo IBD with companies like Cisco hosting numerous events and show cases, and the city using different IoT approaches to its infrastucture (Sensors in roads and computers present in all buildings for climate control and communication).</p>

				<h3>Who is the target audience? Who is being marginalized?</h3>
				<p>Songdo IBD references its own “Master Plan” on their page which states “Songdo IDB is designed around the people who live and work there.”</p>
				<p>“…the planned towns and cities we now see coming up across Asia and Africa are almost exclusively for the wealthy. Unlike their socialist European forebears of the 20th Century, these developments are initiated, planned and built by the private sector, which means, simplistically: they are profit-driven.” – <a href="http://www.newtowninstitute.org/spip.php?article1078">Rachel Keeton.</a></p>
				<p>Due to the top-down approach of Songdo’s design, the only people being considered for Songdo IBD are the people who are there for business. This is because the workers are usually enticed by employment opportunities. Increased amounts of people working in Songdo means business growth which was the primary goal of Songdo IBD.  Due to the focus being profit, any people looking to move there for non-business purposes are not usually catered for, and can find themselves being marginalized.</p>

				<h3>Example Projects</h3>
				<a href="http://www.eco-business.com/news/future-proofing-asian-cities-the-smart-way/"><strong>Garbage Collection</strong></a>
				<p>For most urban residents, the unpleasant whiff of a passing garbage truck is part and parcel of city living. But visitors to Songdo International Business District in South Korea will quickly notice that there are no waste collection vehicles plying the streets. This is because the smart city — a 600-hectare expanse of urban area built from scratch on reclaimed land as a private real estate development project — has a waste collection system using pneumatic tubes. Any trash that is thrown into a bin at home or on the street is transported directly to a central sorting and disposal facility, where it is recycled or incinerated</p>
				<br>
				
				<a href="http://songdoibd.com/about/#history"><strong>Development Projects</strong></a>
				<p>Smart projects are all presented as development projects and the success is measured on how many residents and business move to the area. They also advertise how much of the area is treated as LEED certified space (green public space)</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2009 - Songdo Convensia, Central Park and first commercial and residential projects open; Incheon Bridge is completed, connecting Songdo to Incheon International Airport</li>
					<li>2012 - Selected as host city of Green Climate Fund and World Bank Korea</li>
					<li>2014 - Residential units sold in Songdo IBD footprint passes 14,000 mark; Northeast Asia Trade Tower completed</li>
					<li>2015 - Surpasses 20 million sq ft (1.8 million sq. m) of LEED™-certified space; JNGCK hosts the PGA TOUR’s Presidents Cup 2015 golf tournament in October</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Criticism</h3>
			<p>While there are a lot of positive content being produced and presented in Songdo IBD’s website, the results have been met with mixed opinions. There have been publications stating that since the Songdo project is a private development venture, the focus is on making profit. Due to this, the target audience is often seen as the wealthy, with the city catered to them, disregarding the poor.</p>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>I also have some reservations regarding the business centric approach to a city, where the design is targeted at workers, with non-business residents not being catered for. I found this curious after considering what is happening in Brisbane’s West End, where development is seemingly beginning to overrun the existing culture. With the focus of developer’s being on profit, there is little to no regard when considering any residents that cannot afford to pay for the newly developed real estate. The marginalized population of West End holds some resentment toward the development which is evidently expressed through the various graffiti, protests and feedback we encountered in the suburb of West End. I wonder if Songdo IBD already has similar problems, and if not, is it a likely eventuality?
