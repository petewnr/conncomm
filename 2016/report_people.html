							<h4>West End</h4>
							<p>In West End, we attempted to explore the extent to which people felt connected to others in the area. This was done through a map activity as well as a semi-structured interview. Although we only ended up finding two people to chat with us, we were able to gather that there is a lot of tension between a specific population of people in West End (especially those who might be labelled as “hippies”) and the people who are developing West End. This development can in some ways be seen as an attack on the existing culture in the area. This said, in some ways the continuing gentrification of West End can also been seen as something that brings people together -- in protest, in the maintenance of a counterculture, etc. While the people upset by the gentrification of this area don’t have the power to necessarily stop construction projects and prevent West End from becoming what it will likely become, many at least find value in collectively organizing.</p>

							<h4>Woolloongabba</h4>
							<p>The people of Woolloongabba were a mix of people in celebratory mode and the locals about doing their business.  It was a buzz of anticipation for the first cricket test between Australia and Pakistan. Many people wandering the streets, filling the cafes, and parking illegally as they drop people off and holding up the flow of the traffic.</p>
		 
							<p>All this hype and excitement is what some people liked about the suburb and on a regular basis there was a sense of comradery in the suburb.  This feeling was generating by people who were visitors and not locals. </p>
		 
							<p>The locals had a negative feeling to the day and saw the crowds, noise, congestion, rubbish and foul behavior as a massive intrusion to their suburb.  A community they live in 365 days of the year and then in short spirts of a few days at a time is invaded and abused. This all has arisen by the development of the GABBA and the surrounding are to support and provide for anyone other than the local community.</p>

							<p>The people in this community loved the quieter and relaxed nature and hated the hustle and bustle of the CBD.  Accepting that they had to travel to the CBD and surrounding suburbs to work they were appreciative they had good transport facilities to get them there and home again but it was always important to them that it was the quiet nature of the community that was home.</p>
		 
							<p>Tension was also apparent in the community but as in most of our research it concerned the communication line to and with government.  As a smart city with a focus on business many small businesses within the community were concerned about the lack of respect they have for small business.</p>

							<h4>Mt Gravatt</h4>
							<p>Mt Gravatt has a vibrant populations of international students and also people who lived in the area for quite a long time. Some people we talked to were international students who chooses the area because of its convenient and affordability. While some people are locals who have lived in the area for more than a decade. The Mt Gravatt is part of the main southern bus line, the bus station was quite busy even at non peak hour, people who travels to the cbd or the inner suburbs would take their buses from this station. The station happens to be located very close to the shopping center, the shopping mall is huge and quite busy at the time of our visit, this might be caused by christmas closing in and the fact that when we went there it was almost lunch. It looks like the area was developed as such with the shopping center as the center of the suburb, it might start as a convenient solution for the people in the suburb and surrounding area.</p>

							<h4>Sunnybank</h4>
							<p>Sunnybank on the other hand has a preconception of being dominated by one particular ethnicity group. It seems like our preconception is true, the area are dominated with lots of asian cuisines and asian grocery stores everywhere. The number of eastern asian people walking around the area was greater than the usual amount I see in the other suburbs or the cbd area. The area has developed under a majority of one particular ethnicity it forms its own vibe. It resembles thus big asian cities like Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta, the type of stores and the way people behave in the area bears different attitude. Even so, there are noticeable amount of people from other cultural background as well. The area has it’s own image has grown into a place where it attracts a particular type of people which can be both good and bad for the community as some people who lived in the area for quite sometime has their own objections on people coming in to resides in the area. </p>

							<h4>Reflection on Findings</h4>
							<p>The biggest thing we learned from our visits to some of Brisbane’s suburbs was the variety of mediums through which connection manifests. This really transcended our initial understanding of connection as being predicated on the opportunities that an environment presents for people to be social. In West End, sources of connection were shared (negative) opinions about the ongoing construction projects, and the hippie/bohemian vibe of the area. In Woolloongabba, sources of connection were the stadium, and the vibe of the events occurring. In Camp Hill, sources of connection were the relaxed nature of the suburb, and the accessibility of the city. In Mt Gravatt, sources of connection were the large student population, and the convenience and affordability of the area. And finally, in Sunnybank, sources of connection were cultural groups, and Asian food restaurants/stores. This highlights the ways in which the tangible and intangible dimensions of a location (e.g. infrastructure, predominant political views, etc.) impact the connection that people feel to that location and its population.</p>
							<p>It is particularly important to understand “connection” in this way when the term is usually used (within the context of smart city discourse) to describe the heightened communication and social awareness provided by ICT. Our own findings exemplify that feelings of connectedness (and disconnectedness) go far beyond this, and are largely rooted in the extent to which people share values, opinions, struggles, hopes, etc. When designing for “connected communities,” we may therefore consider how to amplify people’s cognizance of their commonalities.</p>
							<p>Another significant finding of ours was that negative occurrences can either deteriorate or augment one’s sense of connection (based on the perspective that people choose to view the situation from). In Camp Hill, one woman we interviewed mentioned feeling disconnected with the community because of the actions of the local government going back on their initial decision to change a bus route (which negatively impacted her business opportunities). In Woolloongabba, some residents mentioned being annoyed about the rubbish that gets left behind when events are happening, and the time it takes to travel through the suburb when it is packed with visitors. They labelled this as a source of feelings of disconnectedness. Alternatively, in West End, the backpacker stated how the general disgust about the development of the area was bringing people together in protest -- allowing them to connect over a shared vision of what they don’t want West End to become. In some way, this exhibits that feelings of connectedness may arise (as a result of negative occurrences) when people have greater awareness and appreciation of the shared negative sentiments of others. </p>
							<p>From this lens, the residents in Woolloongabba who labelled the rubbish and traffic that result from events as source of feelings of disconnectedness can be seen as feeling such disconnectedness because they view the happenings of the suburb as being in opposition to their own individual wants. While those we spoke to in West End similarly view the construction in the suburb as being in opposition to their own individual wants, they more so recognized themselves as being a part of a greater body of angry people (a community). It was this focus on their anger as something that wasn’t just an individual experience (but rather a manifestation of larger systemic issues that impact others) that ultimately enabled them to feel connection (through solidarity) in response to what was, to them, a negative occurrence. When designing for “connected communities,” it is therefore important not only for us to identify sources of feelings of connectedness and disconnectedness, but to also attempt to understand why such feelings may occur, what such feelings are ultimately grounded in, and what aspects of suburban living could be amplified in order to heighten or diminish the degree to which residents feel a sense of connection. This may go back to people’s cognizance of their commonalities. With further research, we may also identify other things that feelings of connectedness depend upon.</p>

							<h4>Reflection on methods</h4>
							<p>While the insights we gathered from our visits to various suburbs were significant, our methodology was perhaps in need of greater consideration. The probes we deployed did not attract as much engagement as we had hoped. In some cases, our approach did not exhibit sensitivity to the area in which we were trying to collect information. For instance, in West End, many people were hesitant and/or unwilling to talk to us. This may have been due to the fact that the Make a Wish Foundation collectors were just around the corner, trying to get everyone to donate $1 a day to the foundation. As such, people may have been more cautious, and may have been prompted to question what our motives were in wanting to speak with them. In this particular location, it may have been more effective to deploy a probe that did not require any interaction with us. Likewise, simply attending community events may have ended up allowing us to learn more about the connections and disconnections people feel. (This is, of course, something we can still do.) In Woolloongabba and Camp Hill, we asked people why they were at the location they were at. Many people mentioned what they happened to be doing (e.g. relaxing), but did not really tell us why they had chosen that location to do that. As such, it may have been more useful to devise a better question in order to get the information we were really seeking (e.g. What about this place made you decide to come here today?, which puts emphasis on the nature of the place itself). Finally, in Mt Gravatt and Sunnybank, the lack of structure of the interviews we conducted resulted in many answers that were ultimately irrelevant to the topic of connection. In many instances, we really needed to steer the conversation back in this direction. Going forward, we should conduct our research in such a way that makes it more likely for people to share their stories (about connection) with us -- to feel comfortable sharing those stories, to feel like they have the time to share those stories, and also to feel motivated to share such stories.</p>

							<h4>Site Selection</h4>
							<p>After discussing our findings from this activity, we chose to select West End as the site which we will further explore for this project. The reason for this is because we believe that the rapid gentrification of the area (and the effects that this gentrification will have on its relatively ‘alternative’ vibe) presents the strongest opportunity for us to challenge Brisbane’s concept of and development as a (government-run, corporate) “smart city.” In particular, the location stood out to us as an interesting selection because of its notable attraction of hippies, leftists, artists, musicians, vegetarians, etc. After visiting, we found a quote on social media that further solidified our selection of the location as a site of tension created by the increasing amount of construction in the area: “If the corrupt Brisbane City Council and dodgy developers didn't have their hands so deeply in each other's pockets this could have remained as the premiere and preferred place for so many amazing bands to play. So thanks a lot the pair of you two organisations for not consulting with the community, your corporate steamrolling greed and not caring about what is actually needed/wanted in West End. Bye bye Motor Room, Vision Gallery and Boundary St food markets. You were awesome!!!!” </p>
							<p>We consider West End to be a good selection primarily because we believe that there is some sense of “community” that already exists in the location. This isn’t to say that people don’t have feelings of disconnectedness. It’s only to say that some people at least seem to recognize that they are not alone in opposing everything that West End is slowly becoming. They may not be socially very close with many people in the area, but they can at least identify that they are “on the same team” as others who are also being negatively impacted by West End’s rapid gentrification.</p>
