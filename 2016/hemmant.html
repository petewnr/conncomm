			<h2 id="overview">Divide or Connect</h2>
				<p>In this pictorial I am going to look at the physical divide that has split the community of Hemmant and created two distinct areas.  Some major questions I ask about this suburb are: Does the divide pull the community apart or connect them together in some way? Should there be a connection between the two diverse sides?</p>

				<p>Hemmant is a quiet, older suburb to the east of Brisbane.  It was initially one of the original Brisbane and has changed and moved through various farming and industrial focui. It began as a vegetable and fruit farming area but the introduction of industry has changed the suburb. Even today comments on social media see the suburb as a sleepy and friendly place where people know each other and are happy to say hello.</P>
<br />
				<p>The physical structure of a major road and train line has created a significant divide between the residential and the expanding industrial.  Hemmant, a residential and industrial suburb, is 11 km north-east of central Brisbane, lying between the Brisbane River and Wynnum Road. Its western boundary is the Bulimba Creek flood plain (also known as Doughboy or Doboy Creek) in that area, which had fertile soil with light scrub.

		<p>With the significance of the divide, that was created through the middle of Hemmant, there seems to be a segregation in this suburb with neither the two to meet.  There is a link between the two sides with a road and walkway that people transmute to work or to home.  Is there a connection between the two parts of the divide? Does the divide bring the people together? These are the points I will discuss in this pictorial.</p>
		
		<p>In the 2011 census, Hemmant recorded a population of 2,594 people, 50.4% female and 49.6% male. The median age of the Hemmant population was 34 years of age, 3 years below the Australian median.
74.9% of people living in Hemmant were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 8.2%, England 3.3%, Philippines 1.6%, Fiji 0.8%, China 0.5%.
88.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.8% Cantonese, 0.8% Hindi, 0.5% Tagalog, 0.5% Filipino, 0.5% Vietnamese.</p>

		<p>In 1914 Hemmant was given its own railway station and in 1921 a local progress association was formed. This created the divide through the initial suburban farming and residential to create the distinct segregation with the intruding industrial – electrical power station, marine and harbour industries, sugar mills and many various businesses more recently.</p>

			<p>The divide is a physical structure of a four lane motorway and the train line that links the city to the bayside regions beyond Hemmant. The motorway is still the main thoroughfare for people to get from Hemmant to the city or over the Gateway bridge to the northern and bayside suburbs. The train line is the main line from the city to the bayside suburbs.  The only link between the two sections of Hemmant is a road passing over the motorway and railway line. This road is a busy thoroughfare of a mix of vehicles. </p>

			<p>People use the train line to come to Hemmant for work or to leave to go outside of Hemmant. There is a connection as people go to the small store on the main street through the middle of the suburb. Many of the workmen will stop at the small store before driving to the industrial sector. These few minutes present a connection with the workers of the industrial side of the suburb with the residential / commercial business. Workers stopped ever so briefly to get food while the local people, I witnessed bought a paper.  A very relaxed couple walked, hand in hand, to the station to see the husband off to work and while another gentleman running to catch the next train. All using the facility that is the divide as an important part of the community</p>

				<p>As an older suburb that has evolved it, it started with a sense of community as part of a rural community that had a school (opened in 1864), Wesleyan church and dance hall.  The opening of the Cleveland Train line through Hemmant opened it up for many attractions like the Aquarium and a pathway to aquatic activities.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Developers soon moved into Hemmant and industry was the change of focus.  The ageing population saw numbers drop forcing the closure of the Primary school in 2010 and the church no longer functioning as a church but a community hall.  There is strong evidence of a community and even up to recently  wanted to keep it alive.  The divide that has separated the community has been vandalized and the school students beautified the surfaces by removing the graffiti and replacing it with artworks. </p>

				<h3>Discussion</h3>
					<br />
				<p>The burning question is whether the divide creates a connection in the community or a disconnection.  The community is not the same as it used to be when it was first established and the clientelle has changed.  The Census records an ageing population of many retirees who have no connection or interest with the industry on the other side.</p>

	<p>Reviews on the suburb, by people who have moved to the area or have rented one of the few rental properties still consider the rural side of Hemmant peaceful, friendly with loads of atmosphere and fresh air. It is not a flashy suburb and a gemstone and can change overnight if developers moved in.  This is apparent even now and the character of the new locked community dwellings.  The many wide open spaces will disappear and become multiple block dwellings with a massive influx of younger people.</p>
	<p>Will it be likely that the divide that created a divide of residential and industrial be the bringer of life to the ageing community as younger people move to Hemmant to live close to their work.  The new modern houses are affordable and as one reviewer quotes "Hemmant is a great place to raise a family and there is nowhere nearby that is as affordable as Hemmant and close to the city, airport and bayside". </p>
	<p>What will bring this community together? From the observations a key focal point is the small shop where people from the train go to to get food and drink before heading to work on the industrial side while residents go to the shop to collect the paper or food before heading onto the train to go to work in other suburbs. For a brief moment the two sides collide and make a connection. </p>
