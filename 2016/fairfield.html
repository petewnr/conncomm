		<h3> Fairfield - A Realm of Pathways </h3>
		<article class="col-md-12">
		<p> This is an exploration of the suburb of Fairfield through a series of pictures and the observation of a walk around the suburb.

		<h4> The People make the Pathways. </h4>
		<p> The concrete pathways in Fairfield are lacking, and in some cases are non-existant. This leads the people to walk new paths throughout their journey, trail blazing their way through the suburb.  The path made by the people, not by the council, gives the idea that the place is run-down, or unclean. This isn't the case as the area is clean in other regards. The grass is mown, the rubbish is in the bins and there isn't any litter around.

		<h4> The People are Encouraged </h4>
		<p> Roughly half of the population of Fairfield own cars, with the median age as 31, this gives the impression that most people walk or cycle. There is a strong history of cyclistry along the riverfront , which starts at yeronga and winds around towards the city centre. With the shopping centre as a central hub, and only a short distance away, the people of fairfeild are encouraged to walk around. The abundance of parks also add to this encouragement, and they are well kept and clean to further this goal, despite the takeaway and shopping areas right across the road.

		<h4> The People are Invited </h4>
		<p> The pathways are left open and inviting to the people. The fence, boardering a sports club, is built to be open. The parking is closed and locked, but the area is still accessable by people. This allows the people to explore, to adventure without removing the need for fencing. It's almost a compromise between the privacy and security of a private owner, and the local people who visit the facilities. Nobody wants to steal a park.

		<h4> The People are Open </h4>
		<p> The residents are open towards each other and the buildings reflect that. Their homes are close together, like most areas, and yet they often have low fences surrounding them. These seem to be another compromise, between privacy, security and openness. They allow neighbours to chat to each other over the fence, but also allow them to keep a sense of security. Whether it's to stop others from entering, or to prevent animals from leaving the properties, it gives the sense that the community have open connections to each other.

		<h3> Disscussion </h4>
		<p>
		Having walked through the area the first thing that jumps out si the marks that are left behind, and the thinking that goes into the design on an area really piques inerest. The hole in the fence was purposely design so that people can access the grounds, but cars can not. The worn area in the grass where people have walked, despite it's use, wasn't unclean. The people have moved throughout the suburb, in ways that aren't immediately clear, and they respect the area. The parks are clean, the houses are neat and gardens are taken care of. The people make their way through respectfully and almost without trace.
