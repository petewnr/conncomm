			</p>
			<p>
			The remaining framework utilizes the structure and resources and can be further explored below, but one interesting point is the placement of the budget in the framework, and how it could be seen as uninfluencial factor towards the smart city initiative.

			<h3> Example Projects </h3>
			<article class="col-md-8">
			<h4> Remote management of irrigation (water field)</h4>
			<h4>GOAL</h4> 
			<p> Installation of a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system for remote centralized control automated irrigation infrastructure in order to control the duration and frequency of irrigation in each area, depending on the needs.
			</p>
			<h4>SCOPE</h4>
			<p> Development of a system that integrates sensing probes of temperature, salinity and humidity, that allow through an irrigation controller, send the necessary information to the management system SCADA(supervisory control and data acquisition).
