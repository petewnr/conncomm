					<h3>Where it started?</h3>
					<p>On a fine Thursday afternoon, we went out to listen to beautiful voices of
						the Brisbanites within the areas of Mt Gravatt and Sunnybank, and their
						experiences/stories.  We found Mt Gravatt and Sunnybank interesting,
						one is the population surge and popularity growth for Mt Gravatt in the
						recent years especially with more international students coming in and
						staying in the area. While in Sunnybank, the people of Brisbane have their
						preconception about the homogeneous population of Sunnybank and the sense
						of community isolation from the other suburbs out of the Brisbanites
						preconception of the area. In summary, the residents from these two areas
						are living there out of convenience in terms of shopping, food and transport.
						We have found that Sunnybank is highly populated with Asians, which has to
						do a lot with the restaurants that exist around the area, because in an
						Asian culture, food plays a massive part of their daily lives, by that
						we mean people (most likely students) would prefer to eat out than to cook
						their own meals. Mt Gravatt, on the other hand, is still very multicultural.</p>

				<h3>How?</h3>
				<p>On a very rough and simplistic map of Brisbane (as seen on the picture bellow), we asked them to each draw a line which the	direction they would usually travel to and from on a day-to-day basis, however, we soon realised that we were asking southside residents so automatically 80% of them were travelling from the South to the city (Brisbane CBD), with the rare occasion of a lady travelling from the South to further up North to Redcliffe. In addition, we prepared two other tools for our survey which are semi-structured interview questions and posters to kickstart social media trend. The questions we’d like to get answered are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Where can you get the best coffee? <br /> (ice breaker, and to get a sense of familiarity of the person with the area, and probably which area they might be connected to as well)</li>
					<li>What is your earliest memory in [suburb name]? <br /> (to see whether they're from the area or not, and to get a sense of their familiarity with the area)</li>
					<li>What do you do when you're not working? <br /> (what kind of activity present in the area, what type of person (active, social etc)</li>
					<li>If you have to move out from the area what would you miss the most? <br /> (what they think is good about the area, what they like)</li>
					<li>If you have to move out from the area, what would be the number one reason for you to move out?<br /> (what they think is bad about the area, what they dislike)</li>
				</ul>
					
				<p>But during the site survey, we ended up going with an unstructured interview with our correspondents, as we found all of our correspondents were very talkative it was easier to just go with the flow and probe answers within the conversation. We got lots of interesting stories, not only answer people that we correspond with were very eager to share their story. And we found that the older they are the more open they are to sharing their stories. All of these people have one similarity with each other, they love their suburb.</p>

				<h3>Their Story</h3>

				<h4>The Contrariant</h4>
				<p>This one guy, called Cedric (he actually is the only guy who gave his name to us, willingly without being asked), Cedric is the kind of person people would move away and prefer not to talk too long to. The guy has several red, symbolic tattoos up both his arms. These, he described was religious symbols, as he claimed to be a spiritual person. With the Eye of Horus on one hand and the Stargate (yes the movie) symbol he may or may not been talking out of his head, but judging by the man he is, he doesn’t handle progression too well, and after further interactions with him, he mentioned how he doesn’t like developments and the rate it was expanding.</p>
				<p>Cedric’s first memory about the area seems like it was dated way back before the development he talked about the bushes, horse riding in the area and he even informed us of the World War 2 army base along Logan Road. His favourite things to do on his spare time is to go metal detecting and bush walking. He has lived in the area for so long, that he said the changes were too much and the progression was too quick he probably is not the only one and it makes you wonder whether humanity have been progressing too quickly or did Cedric just travel through the Stargate.</p>

				<h4>The Students</h4>
				<p>Most of the people we had approached in Mt Gravatt were at the bus stop waiting for a bus, so all but one were open to talk to us and somewhat willing to answer our questions. One guy who happens to be a uni student told us about how he used to live on the west side of Brisbane, but had moved to the South side about a year ago because he had found that rent was cheaper and there were a lot of restaurants, so a win-win situation really. Another participant who happened to be a student as well had moved into Mt Gravatt twice, once in 2010 with his family until he had to go back home to his country, but he managed to move back to Mt Gravatt in 2013, which we think is quite interesting we tried to dig around, we asked him what he liked in particular about the area and convenience was the answer, and it seems like there are no good enough reasons for him to move away other than family issues.</p>

				<h4>The Community</h4>
				<p>In addition to Mt Gravatt, we dug around Sunnybank, the area was quite busy at the time of our visit granted it was lunch time so people were outside to grab food. We did some observation in Market Square where we decided to put up our posters what we did was more of a site survey at the end of the day as people in the area seemed really busy with themselves. The area reminded me so much of other developed asian cities like Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, the type of stores and the whole ambience doesn’t really scream like Brisbane.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				<p>Compared to the chinatown in Fortitude Valley which looks more like a tourist attraction rather than a real Chinese / Asian community area, Sunnybank resonates well with most Asian cities. Looking into the Times Square how rundown the place and how the aroma of hair products filled the air since there are a few hair salon in the building occupied with mixed demography. Some looked old enough to be a housewife in a mature family and some looked young enough to be in their mid twenties. Some were walking in a quick pace, where some were walking together and chatting. We were able to ask one lady while she talks about her 25 years experience living in Sunnybank and how she liked the southern part of Brisbane she mentioned how much she hates driving to the Northside and just visiting that area in general, in terms of the width of the roads and parking availabilities.</p>
				<p>She seemed like she’s so in love with the area openly analysing how she doesn’t like the new coming “immigrant” who can’t drive and defy the rules most of the time, I clarify it to her if it’s more on the fear of community shaming which looks like started as a generalization and moved into a tasteless jokes and how even a person which I also suspect from her accent came to the country as an immigrant probably more than 25 years of her life in Sunnybank. Her commentary on how the “immigrant” breaking rules and ability to drive is the only thing she hates about the suburb.</p>
