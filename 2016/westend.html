		<h2>What We Were Looking For</h2>
		<p>We went to West End with the intention of exploring the extent to which people felt connected to others living in the area. Though we didn't get the chance to ask them all, we wrote up the following questions before going...</p>
		<br>
		<p>To what extent do you feel disconnected from the people in this suburb?</p>
		<p>Do you feel that you are part of a community? If so, which community? If not, why not?</p>
		<p>Do you actively seek out new connections to/with people? If so, how? And what kind of connections do you seek?</p>
		<p>How often do you talk to people you’ve never met before? In what context does this normally happen? (e.g. sitting next to someone on a bus) Tell us about an experience in which you began talking to someone new, and how the conversation started...</p>
		<br>
		<p>We also brought picture of a map of West End and some markers. We wanted people to annotate the map and color in the parts where they relaxed, shopped, worked, were typically social, etc. Whenever they used the orange marker (to indicate that they were social in a particular area), we tried to prompt them to discuss the ways in which they were social. Specifically, we were looking to know who they were social with (friends or strangers), how many people they were social with, and the extent to which they felt connected to others in the social situations typically occuring in that location.</p>

		<h2>Map Activity</h2>
		<h4> Ainsley </h4>

		<p>
		Ainsley had recently left the area, due to the construction, but still came back occasionally. She drew quite easily and mentioned the annoyance and negative impact of the construction. She also mentioned Cafe 63 and Melbourne Street as places she avoids.

		<h4> The Backpacker </h4>
		<p>The second person had recently began living in the area, just under two weeks, and was there for work. They commented on the negative impact of the construction, and the protest from the locals, which ended with a pause in construction. They then commented that despite the protests, the construction had still gone on as planned and people hadn’t made any more fuss. 
		</p>
		<p>
		They mentioned an area to avoid, but didn’t want to place it on the map. The area was Musgrove Park, and the reason was that some locals would get drunk and boisterous at night time and there were stories of muggings.

		<h2>Observations and Conversations</h2>

		<p>For the group, walking into a suburb equipped with nothing but a few sheets of papers and coloured pens was a daunting task. We parked near Musgrave Park and started for a recommended area, a small sitting area outside Suncorp bank. Just by walking through, it is easy to notice a sense of culture, the paintings, and the different styles of each of the shops. There seemed to be a bar or coffee shop on every street corner.</p>

		<p>The first person we engaged with was a guy named Patrick, who was trying to raise money for the Make A Wish Foundation. It was actually him who engaged with us for that reason. After he finished trying to convince us to donate $1 a day to the foundation, we managed to chat with him for a minute about why we were there. We were mindful not to ask him too many questions, as we knew that he was working. We did manage to find out that he was from Canada and had moved to Brisbane because of friend of his also lives here. One interesting thing he said was that he feels quite connected to other street collectors in West End. All of his work colleagues like to hang out together, spend their breaks together, and get drinks together. He mentioned that there is a very high rate of staff overturn. He stated that most people only last a week, and that those remain become fast friends, bonded through an understanding of the ordeals they go through from being in that profession.</p>


		<p>After chatting with Patrick, we walked around several streets in West End and asked random people if they had five minutes to spare. Many people said they didn’t. Some had work. Some said they were in a rush. Some just flat out told us that they didn’t really want to talk to us at all. In fact, one guy mentioned that he hates being accosted in the street by people (he mentioned not liking the Make A Wish Foundation guys being just around the corner). Despite this, he did engage with us a little and told us that he doesn’t feel that he belongs to any communities in West End. He also mentioned that there are many interesting characters in the area.</p>

		<p>We continued walking around the area, looking for people who seemed like they weren't in a rush. We saw a man muttering to himself, two people sleeping on the concrete outside a closed store, and many people on bikes.</p>


		<p>The first person who agreed to chat with us for five minutes was Ainsley. She actually had all of the visual signs of a person who would ignore us. She had her head down looking at her phone, and was walking and wearing earphones. We approached her and explained that we were doing a university study, to which she replied that she would happy oblige. When we asked her if she felt connected to people in the area, she said that she felt connected to the people she knows. She also mentioned that she often gets to know the people who are friends with her friends. Despite this, she considered the area to be quite cliquey sometimes with people only really talking to those who were similar to them. Ainsley found many of the people she is now friends with through an online group for housemates. She said she only moved out of West End because of the construction, which bothered her. After a successful conversation with Ainsley, we moved on with more confidence.</p>


		<p>It seemed our confidence was short lived, as everyone we attempted to speak to declined due to work, being in a rush or just telling us “no” or “sorry."" After failing numerous times at engaging people (and taking a short break at a local cafe, Three Monkeys), we decided to head to Musgrave Park. We thought that we’d perhaps run into people who were more willing to give up five minutes in this space. We ended up talking to a backpacker from the UK who was sitting alone in the park. He had been in West End for two weeks and knew some people in the area prior to coming. In terms of the connection he felt to others in the area, he said that he really enjoyed the sort of hippie and bohemian vibe of the area. He liked that he could just go into this bar called Rompers Room and already know the type of people that would be there and that he could most definitely have a good conversation with those people. He described the bar as “a very hippie, strange, good, weird place.” He doesn’t think the hippies will last much longer in West End though. He was telling us that many of the hippies came from the suburb of New Farm, which eventually became very gentrified, causing the hippies to flock to West End. He doesn’t really see where the hippies and their culture will end up going next, but he seemed to be positive that money/corporations would ultimately de-bohemian-ize the area. He said that West End is essentially just the “Byron Bay of Brisbane.” It has been attracting many backpackers, but is only becoming more and more commercial with fancier apartment complexes being built. One thing he mentioned was the construction of this cement facility and how all these people in West End were protesting it. Ultimately the people lost and the construction was approved, but this didn’t end the protesting. He concluded by stating that West End is comprised of various like-minded communities, and he feels that particular types of cultures that exist there are being threatened by the increasing commercialization of the area.</p>

		<h2>Discussion</h2>
		<p>Although we didn’t talk to too many people in the area, what we gathered was that there is a lot of tension between a specific population of people in West End and the people who are developing West End. In some way, the development of West End can be seen as an attack on the “hippie culture” that exists there. It could essentially kill off this culture and motivate people who embrace it to move outside of the area. That said, in some ways the continuing gentrification of West End may also bring people together -- in protest, in the maintenance of a counterculture, etc. Graffitied on the street we saw: “RESIST. REVIVE. DECOLONIZE.” In many ways, the increased amount of construction in the area can be seen as something that has further connected those in the area who share negative sentiments about it. These people don’t have the power to necessarily stop construction projects and prevent West End from becoming what it will likely become, but many at least find value in collectively organizing.</p> 


		<p>What we found most significant from our visit to West End was something the backpacker had said -- that he felt connected to the community despite only having been there for two weeks and not really having met heaps of people. We hypothesize that he found “connection” in the values/identities he shares with others in the area. This leads us to consider a broader definition of connection -- one that isn’t just based on the extent to which those in a community are communicating. Connection can also be felt through common struggles, common values, and common hopes.</p>

				<h2>Further Thoughts and Observations</h2>
				<p>For the group, walking into a suburb equipped with nothing but a few sheets of papers and coloured pens was a daunting task. We parked near Musgrave Park and started for a recommended area, a small sitting area outside Suncorp bank. Just by walking through, it is easy to notice a sense of culture, the paintings, and the different styles of each of the shops. There seemed to be a bar or coffee shop on every street corner.</p>

				<p>We were making our way through one of the busiest parts of West End when we were actually approached by Patrick from the make a wish foundation (see above for details). One thing he detailed about the solidarity he felt with his colleagues is that there is a very high rate of staff overturn. He stated that most people only last a week, and that those remain become fast friends, bonded through an understanding of the ordeals they go through from being in that profession.</p>
				<p>After our discussion with Gavin we walked further toward the seating area, we found a person muttering to himself while sitting and a man with a high visual shirt smoking. Feeling a little underwhelmed, we walked uphill to observe more before asking questions. We witnessed 2 people sleeping on the concrete outside a closed store as well as a lot of people that seemed in a rush.</p>

				<p>The first person that we managed to start a dialogue with actually had all of the visual signs of a person who would ignore us. She had her head down looking at her phone, walking and wearing earphones. We approached her and explained that we were doing a university study, to which she replied that she would happy oblige. (see above for details). She said that people here can be mean, but after a successful conversation, we moved on with more confidence.</p>
				<p>It seemed our confidence was short lived, as everyone we attempted to speak to declined due to work, being in a rush or just telling us “no” or “sorry”. One such gentleman seemed friendly enough and assured that he had nothing against us, but hated the idea of being approached on the street.</p>
				<p>At this point we decided to take a small break at a local cafe named Three Monkeys in order to rehydrate. During this time, we noticed that there was a lot of advertisement for the local gallery and for local plays.</p>
				<p>After our break we decided to head to a park, reasoning that people there would be less likely to be in a rush. The last male that we spoke to was from the United Kingdom, and stated that he had only been here 2 weeks. (see above for details). He mentioned that he did indeed feel like a part of a community here, but only because he had existing relationships in the area. He also mentioned that West End was a community comprised of smaller like-minded communities, and he felt that particular types of cultures were under threat from commercialization.</p>
