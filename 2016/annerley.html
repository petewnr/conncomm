				<h1>Annerley</h1>
			<section>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The survey site, Annerley is a suburb located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south of the Brisbane CBD. The suburb is of medium population density with many apartment blocks, guest houses and fast-food outlets. The major road in the suburb is Ipswich Road, one of Brisbane's main southerly traffic arteries. In the 2011 census, Annerley recorded a population of 10,664 people. The median age of the Annerley population was 32 years. 62.1% of people living in Annerley were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%.</p>
				<h3>Provocation</h3>
				<p>Through this site survey, I want to raise the provocation about who are the contributors to the opening and inviting atmosphere of the suburb; how do those contributors share and interact with each other in the community?</p>

				<h3>School and Residential Area</h3>
				<p>In photograph A, anyone can get access to the school playground without fences.</p>
				<p>Photograph B is a residential house located in Ipswich road. The inner space of the house looked like a dining area. But it was interestingly exposed by the transparent floor windows covering the full width of the house. </p>
				<p>Photograph C is another residential house in inner street. It was taken during morning time at around 10am. No one was there but the back door of the car and the yard remained opened. </p>
				<p>Photograph D was captured in the other inner street. It says “Simon Says, SLOW DOWN in our street”. </p>

				<h3>Infrastructures by City Council</h3>
				<p>Photograph E and F were taken at Annerley Library located in the middle of Annerley police station and  Junction Park State School. It is noticeable that the infrastructure are very new and complete. Although the library is house-like and relative small (around 200 square meters), there are parking lots for both mikes and cars. Notices of different events were attached on each of the windows. Water fountain and benches are provided for people who stay outside the library.</p>
				<p>Photograph G and H were one of the biggest park in Annerley. Short fences and sandy floor were set up to protect the kids playing in the park. There was a pair of grandparents sitting at the benches and under the shades. </p>

				<h3>Public Space</h3>
				<p>Photograph I is a painting captured at the edge of Junction Park State School. If looked closely, the flowers are handmade with different handwritings in simple words- most likely they were made by students in the school.</p>
				<p>Photograph J and K are the street view in Ipswich Road, at which the main commercial shops are located. People in the photographs are mainly elders, few are students. They all walked slowly, which brought a great contrast to the speeding cars along the road. The main activities involved in the photos are walking to grocery shops, resting and waiting for buses. </p>
				<p>Photograph L and M showed more details of the main pedestrian in Ipswich Road. Although the tiles of the pedestrian path was uneven and looked wore out, it is obvious that the path was cleaned and well maintained. Particularly, there were Christmas decoration wrapped for most of the street poles, lamp poles and even the restrict parking sign. On the other hand, there was only bare soil in the the planting pot with graffiti. </p>

				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<p>Overall, the suburb is filled with openness and inviting atmosphere through looking into how the houses are set and respond to neighbourhood. It is also interesting that Brisbane
					City Council puts effort in building the public facility while remain some existing places old and under maintainance - the uneven footpath and planter box. In the contrast,
					it is apparent that the communities of this suburb have been voluntarily taken care of the places where the Council have not - the cleanness and tidiness of the commercial area
					and the “illegal” Christmas decoration. It will be worth exploring that what are the motivations behind the community to engage with their neighbourhood and how do the residents and
					council interact with each other through the surroundings. In terms of the limitation of this site survey, I might have bias of assuming that retirees were the main residents of
					the suburb since I was only there slightly after peak time - 8am to 10am. After some post research, I found that this suburb is actually recommeded as suitable and convenient place for
					young professionals and students to stay in. This means that I may have missed the connection , or there are disconnections between Annerley or young adults. </p>
