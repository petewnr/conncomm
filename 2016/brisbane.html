					<h3>How Brisbane defines itself as a smart city</h3>
				</section>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
					<p>Brisbane City Council has a defined vision for the city which outlines "aspirations for our city's future and outlines ideas for achieving this vision".  Within that vision there are 8 programs developed.  Whilst each program has aspects that are aimed at making Brisbane a Smart Connected City, two programs have a specific focus around this.</p>

					<h4>The Brisbane City Council Vision Programs</h4>
				</section>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
					<strong class="pushbottom">Our accessible connected city</strong>
					<p>This program states:</p>
					<div class="bg-warning panel panel-warning">
						<div class="panel-body">
							<p class="text-warning">In 2031, Brisbane will be an accessible city for everyone. Residents, workers, students, visitors and business people will be able to move easily throughout the city.</p>
		
							<p class="text-warning">Road, public transport and active transport networks will provide safe, efficient, fast and reliable travel options throughout the city. These networks will help deliver economic benefits to Brisbane and support our growing community and changing economy.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Whilst this program refers to being 'connected' as a key focus, the targets of that program indicate a focus on transportation and the use of transportation other than personal cars.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section class="col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
					<strong class="pushbottom">Our smart prosperous city</strong>
					<p>This program states:</p>
					<div class="bg-warning panel panel-warning">
						<div class="panel-body">
							<p class="text-warning">In 2031, Brisbane will offer a business-friendly environment and its business culture will be highly regarded for its positive, collaborative approach.</p>
							<p class="text-warning">Brisbane's high performing economy will be known for its strong business and cultural links with Asia and will be the leading Australian hub for global companies servicing the Asia Pacific region.</p>
							<p class="text-warning">Brisbane's highly-skilled workers will be a major competitive advantage for local businesses and attract new businesses to the city. </p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>This program is clearly focused on business and economy.  The first target though is directly aimed at people referring to an increase in average income to $75,000 per annum.  Interestingly this is referred to as "standard of living" rather than income, so it is tying standard of living to income.  Other aspects include: a growth in the Brisbane economy (expressed in monetary terms and the number of jobs); a growth in the digital economy; the satisfaction levels of business' dealings with council; and, the desire to attract international students to Brisbane.</p>
				</section>
			</div>
			
			<br />
			
			<div class="row pushtop">
				<section class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
					<p>There are other programs as part of the vision that are aimed at having an impact on the experience of living in Brisbane.  For example: the program 'Our clean, green city' includes targets such as 40% of mainland Brisbane consisting of natural habitat and the improvement of waterway health.  Also, the 'Our vibrant, creative city' aims to change Brisbane's creative culture.  This also has 'digital dimension'.</p>
					<div class="bg-warning panel panel-warning">
						<div class="panel-body">
							<p>Brisbane will be a vibrant, 24-hour, cultural city - a city that attracts creative endeavours and people, enables innovation and applies its ingenuity to activities that have an enormously positive effect on the economy, including in the digital sphere.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br />
					<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>Interestingly, the Brisbane City Council also is involved in a website called "CitySmart", the focus of which seems to be on sustainability.</p>
					<p>Currently the site indicates that the collaboration is funding a number of projects ranging from electric car charging stations to apps to help individuals understand their energy consumption.</p>
					<p>Whilst not explicitly directed to the 'smart city' concept, many of the projects funded by this collaboration are focused on smart city technology.</p>

					<h4>Brisbane 2022 World City Action Plan</h4>
				</section>
			</div>
			
			<br />
			
			<div class="row pushtop">
				<section class="col-lg-8">
					<p>Yet another program that Brisbane has running is the <a href="http://www.choosebrisbane.com.au/2022plan?sc_lang=en-au" target="_blank">Brisbane World City Action Plan</a> which is focused on the economic development of Brisbane over the next seven years.  In particular it seeks to develop Brisbane in terms of the global market place.  Brisbane's involvement in this program is based on the view of Brisbane as "Australia's New World City".  These new world cities are defined by the following criteria:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Are mid-sized</li>
						<li>Are affordable</li>
						<li>Are agile</li>
						<li>Offer quality education options</li>
						<li>Have expert specialisations within a managed metropolis</li>
						<li>Offer an optimal work-life balance</li>
						<li>Have efficient infrastructure</li>
						<li>Have problem-solving capabilities</li>
						<li>Have low congestion, inflation and pollution</li>
						<li>Are safe and secure</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Other cities that have defined themselves as new world cities include: Barcelona, San Diego, Singapore, Miami and Cape Town.  Brisbane, as a new world city, has defined for itself seven priority areas (see aside).  The plan identifies industries of focus as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Knowledge-based and Corporate Services</li>
						<li>Accommodation and Visitor Economy</li>
						<li>Higher and International Education</li>
						<li>Energy and Resources</li>
						<li>Creative and Digital</li>
						<li>Property Development and Construction</li>
						<li>Advanced Manufacturing</li>
						<li>Food and Agribusiness</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It also identifies unique precincts that Brisbane should continue to develop their character and culture.  These were: industry, retail and entertainment.  There is a strong focus on technology based industry as " in the sector, five additional jobs are created in other sectors".  There is also a focus on Small-Medium Enterprise and a strategy developed to provide support to that business sector.  The plan also recognises Brisbane's connection to regions beyond Brisbane and their impact or influence on " Growth, tourism, export, investment and infrastructure".</p>

					<h3>Who is driving the Brisbane smart city movement</h3>
				</section>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
					<p>Brisbane City Council appears to be the main driver for the Brisbane smart city movement.  The involvement of other stakeholders appears to be specific to the different faces of the movement.  However, there is a very strong push (or pull, depending on how you view the funding model) coming from the Federal Government through their "Smart Cities Plan".</p>
					<br />
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxVoDzsn0pE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>Some of the key words I picked up from that address were:</p>
					<blockquote class="text-warning">"Liveable cities, cities that work ... planning is critical ... we have to work together ... we want to have liveable cities - public space, green space ... good transport infrastructure ... so people aren't spending hours tied up in traffic ... by our nature we are social animals ... most creative ... when we are together"</blockquote>
					<p>But there was a strong connection between liveable cities and the economic benefits that then flow.  At the moment, their 'Smart Cities and Suburbs' program is still working through how it will operate and there is a call for submissions on programs and funding processes.  The interest is around the funding that is available through this program:</p>
					<blockquote class="text-warning">The Australian Government’s $50 million Smart Cities and Suburbs Program will support projects that apply innovative smart technology solutions to urban problems. The program will encourage collaborative initiatives involving local governments, the private sector, research organisations and not for profit bodies to improve the liveability, productivity and sustainability of Australian cities, suburbs and towns.</blockquote>

					<h5>Comments on the Brisbane Round table</h5>
					<p>As part of the start of the program, national roundtables took place where "stakeholders come together to inform program design".  The outputs from this roundtable have been made available publically.  The roundtables did not target the general public.  These consultations have just opened (13 December 2016) and close on 20 January 2017.</p>
					<p>Full information from the <a href="https://cities.dpmc.gov.au/smart-cities-program" target="_blank">Brisbane roundtable</a> is available on the Dept of Prime Minister and Cabinet website.  However, here are some of the comments made/recorded.</p>

					<p>So, whilst Brisbane City Council is the main driver, the Federal Government also appears to have a significant influence on this drive.  This may simply be the potential for access to funding but, in my opinion, it is more than this as, to be realistic, the potential for a share of $50m seems to be a comparatively low financial incentive.</p>

					<h3>Why is Brisbane wanting to become a smart city?</h3>

			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
					<p>From the vision, the motivation is based in improving the city.  However the underlying issues aren't explicitly stated anywhere on the websites that deal with the City vision. However, the <a href="https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/sites/default/files/Brisbane_Vision_2031_full_document.pdf" target="_blank">2031 Vision</a> document provides some indications of what might be the Council's motivation.</p>
					
					<div class="bg-warning panel panel-warning">
						<div class="panel-body">
							<h5>Key phrases extracted from the introduction to the Brisbane Vision 2031 document</h5>
							<p>Brisbane is a city that is growing and changing.</p>
							<p>Although our population growth is slowing, it continues to be a significant driver of our economy. </p>
							<p>... roughly 180,000 are expected to settle within the Brisbane Local Government Area (LGA), bringing the total population of the LGA to over 1.27 million. This will include a growing number of skilled overseas migrants attracted to the expanding Brisbane economy.</p>
							<p>We must continue to invest in Brisbane’s international profile as a place that is not only friendly to visit but also a place where it’s easy to do business.</p>
							<p>... make sure the important aspects about Brisbane are preserved for future generations by making the right decisions to achieve the future we want</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<br />
					
					<div class="bg-warning panel panel-warning">
						<div class="panel-body">
							<h5>The priority areas</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>maintain or improve quality of life for the
Brisbane community</li>
								<li>ensure that Brisbane has the services and infrastructure to meet the liveability and sustainability challenges of the future</li>
								<li>provide an overarching plan of action for Council, its partners and the people of Brisbane for the next 18 years.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<br />
					
					<p>The motivation for Brisbane to become a smart city is based on an increasing population and the consequent pressure that is places on different aspects of the city, in particular the ability of the Brisbane economy to sustain the population.  Brisbane's strategy is to both develop and attract new industry to Brisbane and has a strong focus on making it easier for business to operate.  This is clear from the stated goals of some of the programs forming the Brisbane strategy.</p>
					<p>Whilst it seems the strongest focus is on business or commerce, Brisbane clearly has additional areas of focus: sustainability (the citysmart program and the fact that the 'connected city' program's focus is on using alternative modes of transport), improving people's experience in living in the city and improving quality of life.  However, with respect to quality of life, it is interesting that Brisbane's measure for quality of like is average income.</p>

					<p>As Brisbane sees creation and attraction of new industry and business as the solution to the issues it faces, the innovator, entrepreneur and business person are clearly privileged in Brisbane's model of a smart connected city.  Brisbane's focus on making it easier for businesses to work with them without a corresponding goal for individual people openly sends this message. In our view, the best example of this prioritisation can been seen in the development of the "Brisbane, Australia's New World City Action Plan".  Whilst the Brisbane Vision 2031 priorities are centred around concepts such as liveability, quality of life and sustainability, the development of the economic plan was entrusted only to industry.</p>
					<br />
					<blockquote>The great cities of the world are those whose communities share a
vision for their city and work together to achieve it. The outcome of
that shared goal is enhanced social and economic prosperity for all.</blockquote>
					<caption>The introduction to <strong>The Consultation Process</strong> for the New World City plan</caption>
					<br />
					<br />
					<p>Brisbane's focus and implementation of its strategy, clearly prioritises the voice of business over the voice of the people.  Whilst, the intention of this focus on business is to provide benefit to people through an improved economy and the benefits that then flow on, it is questionable whether the way in which Brisbane is implementing its vision is truly engaging with its people.</p>

Brisbane has partnered with two organisations that have provided co-working spaces elsewhere - <a href="http://littletokyotwo.com/" target="_blank">Little Tokyo Two</a> and <a href="http://fishburners.org/" target="_blank">Fishburners</a>.  Brisbane has committed $5m over the next 5 years to supporting the facility.</p>
					<p>From a <a href="http://www.digitalbrisbane.com.au/news/~/media/Digital%20Brisbane/News%20Stories/TheCapitalLaunch_20161019_wide.ashx">report</a> by Digital Brisbane:"</p>
					<blockquote>Central to the hub strategy is connectivity to the local, national and international startup ecosystems to enable meaningful collaborations with the brightest minds in the knowledge economy. Cr Quirk said Brisbane not only embraced the disruptive technologies re-shaping our world, but this initiative would also help the city to play a key role in creating and exporting them to global markets.</blockquote>
