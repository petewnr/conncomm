			<h3>Smart buildings – Port</h3>
				<p>The Port of San Diego is a demonstration of smart technology committed to reducing the city’s carbon footprint. To do this The city uses smart sensors, big data, and predictive analytics as powerful tools as arsenal toward achieving our greenhouse gas reduction goals. The Port is installing solar panels on the roof of its primary cruise ship terminal, which is expected to offset approximately 70 percent of the building’s energy consumption. It is effectively a huge power source that feeds energy back into the city’s power grid without the use of carbon fuels.</p>

Forty percent of greenhouse emissions come from transportation - cars, trucks and motorbikes.  By using electric cars and electric car power stations San Diego has been able to reduce gas emissions and transition to a cleaner environment and energy independence.  As one of the nation’s leading cities in adopting clean transportation, San Diego has one of the nation’s highest levels of electric vehicle drivers per capita – 21710 electric cars, 1092 public charging stations and 75 DC fast chargers.</p>

			<h3>City for the people</h3>

				<article class="col-lg-6 col-xs-12">
				<p>Developing run down areas of the city has given these areas life and encouraged people to come to these spaces that are now full of life and the heritage of San Diego has been restored. One such district is the Gaslamp Quarter - a district usually run down no inhabited (bad things happened and was dark) and has been transformed to preserve the beauty of the historical area. The development has flourished with restaurants, residencies and sporting facilities that bring people to this area that is now an important part of the city.  These are world class facilities that draw in people from all over the world.</p>
				<p>In changing the site, the plan was to make it different, vibrant and an exciting area that will make it a more liveable district.  The goal being to increase population to the area and create more employment.  Facilities that brought people to the area were:</p>
				<p>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					  <li>New residential buildings and people brought there by a cultural hub - library </li>
					  <li>Sporting facilities and convention centres</li>
					  <li>Port area</li>

			<h2 id="impact">Is it really making an impact on peoples lives?</h2>
				<p>The people of San Diego have shown great commitment to the development of the Smart city and taken ownership.  Although there is funding from businesses the local people are able to be involved with fundraising for facilities - the library in the down town region. Although I have not been able to find statistical data that shows the improvement of within the city there is obvious development that makes regions more appealing and liveable.</p>

			<h3 id="criticism">Criticism</h3>
				<p>San Diego has presented a plan to make life better for it's residence and in doing so will be giving back to the earth by not taking and destroying Mother nature. This is always a positive if the earth is saved.</p>
				<p>To make criticism of a city considered to be smart you need to look at the aspects they have tried to change.  From the research I have looked at the key aspects needed to make change are: Energy, Energy, Finance, Mobility, ICY and cyber security and the General liveability of the city.  San Diego has been able to address all of these aspects to make it a Smart City and a place where people want to visit and live.</p>
