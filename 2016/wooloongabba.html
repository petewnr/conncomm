				<h3>Our goals for this investigation</h3>
				<p>Our goal this morning was to investigate the connection people had with various suburbs and the strength of these connections.  Our intention was to uncover what was important to them and if things changed in their suburbs how would the good and bad aspects of the change impact on them.</p>
<br />
				<p>To probe for this information we created three forms of enquiry:
<br />	
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					<li>on-line survey sent through Facebook to friends and family </li>
					<li>A prompt on posters supplying people with hashtags to present information via various social media</li>
					<li>Personal interview on the sidewalks of the suburbs</li>
				</ul>

			<section class="col-lg-12 col-xs-12">
				<p>For the interviews and prompts we posed three opened questions that we hoped people would openly describe their feelings and views about those questions.  The three questions were:</p>
<br />
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					  <li>Tell us why you are here at this place now. </li>
					  <li>Tell us about your favourite place.</li>
					  <li>Tell us about your least favourite place.</li>

<br />
			<section class="col-lg-8 col-xs-12">
				<p>These questions were presented on a noticeboard and the facility for people to write their comments underneath. The pictures around the question was used to grab the people’s interest without leading them to a specific direction in their answer.  Using different coloured pens the noticeboard looked more appealing and eye catching while being a bit of fun.</p>
<br />
				<p>The prompts had exactly the same approach but being more open ended to allow people to interpret the question in any way they wished.  The survey questions are presented below. </p>

				<h4>Woolloongabba</h4>			
				<p>The GABBA was a hive of activity because of an international cricket match between Australia and Pakistan happening today.  For most of the people we interviewed the connection to the suburb was the game – either attending the game or working at the venue. </p>
<br />
				<p>It was very difficult to get people to stop and talk because they were busy meeting up with someone, going to work or just going somewhere else (not where we were).  All moved with purpose and the personal barriers of sunglasses and earphones made it difficult to approach.  One person even pointed at his ears and the implication was “I have earphones in  . .  . are you real, you can’t talk to me”.</p>

				<p>The people we did talk to, who were going to the match, were excited and vibrant and happy to be there, in their social groups, and were positive about being there.  This was the place they wanted to be at this moment in time.  It was very different to where they would consider where they would like to be on a regular basis, with most people saying “it was their home that was important and their favourite place to be”.  Those places are where they do what they do – enjoy the peaceful life of the beach side township of 1770 or Texas where an accountant could go roo shooting. </p>
<br />
				<p>This strong tie to where people drew their connection or disconnection of place also seemed to be not always of a specific geographical region.  One young lady we interviewed saw that her home in bed was the most favourite place to be and she hated the crowded and busy traffic of Brisbane.  She was a north side resident dropping her brother off at the GABBA for work and was frustrated with the amount of traffic there and around the city. </p>

				<p>This strong connection to the person’s suburb was also apparent with the few local residents of the GABBA region.  They were in the GABBA doing their business (shopping and returning misaddressed post parcel) and couldn’t think of living anywhere else.  They loved living there because of the vibrant nature and the interesting characters of the suburb. </p>
<br />
				<p>These local resident tended to be older and were relaxed, less in a rush and very happy to chat. They were just as interested to know who we were and why we were there as we wanted to know about them.  For them they liked the business of the GABBA as it was developed and eclectic and had the facilities they wanted or the ability to get to them.  They would not want to be where facilities weren’t accessible -  a third world country such as Somalia.</p>

				<p>We set up our question board in a small strip mall area of Camp Hill for half an hour. This place was near to a few shops like an Op shops, Gym and some clinics and a bus stop.  It was about 11.30am and there were a few people about going to the medical clinics and mainly to get tot he bus stop.  There was one person at the coffee shop and two people working in the coffee shop.</p>

				<p>The people we interviewed were a mix of mainly elderly, some young and families. All at the site for different connections.  People tended to be more relaxed and conscious of the surroundings and walked slower - an elder guy walked by the noticeboard and read the signs for more than 2 minutes. Luckily we attached our hashtag signs on a noticeboard prior to that. We look forward to see whether he makes a comment on twitter. </p>
<br />
				<p>Interviewing the ladies in the coffee shop, gave me important information about where was actually public space and where to set up the billboard.  As a business owner at this busy she expressed her disconnection with most of the community because of the broken promises and constraints placed on them by the local government.  After being informed of changes to bus travel and being encouraged to set up a small business in this area with a captive audience of commuters, the council changed their decision leaving them with an outlet that wasn't able to service the customers. </p>

A lady with the barriers of sunglasses rejected to give us time initially because she was rushing for bus. When we moved our board behind her, she actually turned back and said sorry that she couldn’t help us because she had a bus to catch.  She was friendly and charitable. </p>

				<p>The people at Camp Hill were at the place for various reasons: visiting clinic for x-ray, working and owning the cafe. All bar the people who ran the coffee shop were from the suburb.</p>
<br />
				<p>Living a very relaxed lifestyle was important to them and prompted the response that this place is where they would consider as an important place for them to live. They all liked the suburb because it was close enough to the city without having the hussle and bussle and ‘mayhem’ of the CBD.  It was a ‘great place to live and work’, ‘the people are nice and friendly’ and it just a relaxed suburb. As with previous results it was the familiarity of the surrounding that makes it home and where they would call there place. All responded that even though it was essential to go to the city it was not a place for them and it was great to come home in the evenings.</p>
<br />
				<p>All chose places that were even more relaxed - Wynnum Manly - bayside suburb and where there is water or the beach for them to relax as their favourite places to be. Even though they live in a fairly relaxed suburb, they are there because of the access to where they work or study and are able to come home.  It was the facility to relax for them that was important.  Camphill has recreational facilities like parks and some sporting arenas, they prefer to get to the beach/water to relax and it is only a short drive away.</p>

				<p>The places they disliked were the opposite of where they are right now or what they consider as their desired place.  An elderly lady didn’t like the city because it is very ‘busy, congested traffic and difficult to find parking. Places that caused stress and ill feeling were the places that people didn’t like which was a real contrast to where they are and what they like - busy environment (CBD). The two ladies at the coffee shop chose the dump as their least favourite place for similar reasons as it is always busy and it smells.</p>
				<p>There could be questions raised if this spot of Camphill is a place where these people like or dislike as it was the connection point for so many different things - for the commuters it was the place of catching the bus to take them to the city (their least favourite place). For the elderly it is a place of bad feelings as they are going to the clinics for good or bad reasons.  For the ladies in the coffee shop it was a place of broken promises and a less productive business adventure.</p>
				<p>There is always going to be the connections of people they meet on a daily basis and get to know that will make this place a better place.</p>

				<p>Both of the site investigations were very different.  Both had a great sense of belonging to the community at that time, whether it be for an event, for work or in transit to going somewhere else.  Both suburbs had a different vibe which was important the people.  Both groups liked the suburbs in which they lived because of the accessibility to other places and the sense of community.  Each suburb is where they call home and were accepting of the suburb. </p>
<br />
				<p>All were connected to their home community because of the things they do on a regular basis. Whether it be that they come to the GABBA for an event on a regular basis to enjoy the hype of the game and the comradery of the crowd, being an Aussie,  against an opposing cricket team or do the regular mundane things of everyday life they have some connection to the place</p>
<br />				
								<p>They form connections with supporters, the regular people they meet each day at the bus stop or coffee shop or the clinic for an x-ray. They all mean something to each and everyone of the people and these connections help build a sense of community.  Even the disconnection that people have with the council and council infrastructures bring the people together for a different reason.</p>

Within the first two hours we had already achieved more than the number of people we were able to get to interview.  The people on Facebook are friends and are quite happy to provide a response where strangers are more reluctant to be responsive to a stranger approaching them in the street.</p>
