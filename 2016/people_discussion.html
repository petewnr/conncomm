					<h3>Reflection on Findings</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-8">
					<p>The biggest thing we learned from our visits to some of Brisbane’s suburbs was the variety of mediums through which connection manifests. This really transcended our initial understanding of connection as being predicated on the opportunities that an environment presents for people to be social. In West End, sources of connection were shared (negative) opinions about the ongoing construction projects, and the hippie/bohemian vibe of the area. In Woolloongabba, sources of connection were the stadium, and the vibe of the events occurring. In Camp Hill, sources of connection were the relaxed nature of the suburb, and the accessibility of the city. In Mt Gravatt, sources of connection were the large student population, and the convenience and affordability of the area. And finally, in Sunnybank, sources of connection were cultural groups, and Asian food restaurants/stores. This highlights the ways in which the tangible and intangible dimensions of a location (e.g. infrastructure, predominant political views, etc.) impact the connection that people feel to that location and its population. It is particularly important to understand “connection” in this way when the term is usually used (within the context of smart city discourse) to describe the heightened communication and social awareness provided by ICT. Our own findings exemplify that feelings of connectedness (and disconnectedness) go far beyond this, and are largely rooted in the extent to which people share values, opinions, struggles, hopes, etc. When designing for “connected communities,” we may therefore consider how to amplify people’s cognizance of their commonalities.</p>

					<p>Another significant finding of ours was that negative occurrences can either deteriorate or augment one’s sense of connection (based on the perspective that people choose to view the situation from). In Camp Hill, one woman we interviewed mentioned feeling disconnected with the community because of the actions of the local government going back on their initial decision to change a bus route (which negatively impacted her business opportunities). In Woolloongabba, some residents mentioned being annoyed about the rubbish that gets left behind when events are happening, and the time it takes to travel through the suburb when it is packed with visitors. They labelled this as a source of feelings of disconnectedness. Alternatively, in West End, the backpacker stated how the general disgust about the development of the area was bringing people together in protest -- allowing them to connect over a shared vision of what they don’t want West End to become. In some way, this exhibits that feelings of connectedness may arise (as a result of negative occurrences) when people have greater awareness and appreciation of the shared negative sentiments of others. From this lens, the residents in Woolloongabba who labelled the rubbish and traffic that result from events as source of feelings of disconnectedness can be seen as feeling such disconnectedness because they view the happenings of the suburb as being in opposition to their own individual wants. While those we spoke to in West End similarly view the construction in the suburb as being in opposition to their own individual wants, they more so recognized themselves as being a part of a greater body of angry people (a community). It was this focus on their anger as something that wasn’t just an individual experience (but rather a manifestation of larger systemic issues that impact others) that ultimately enabled them to feel connection (through solidarity) in response to what was, to them, a negative occurrence. When designing for “connected communities,” it is therefore important not only for us to identify sources of feelings of connectedness and disconnectedness, but to also attempt to understand why such feelings may occur, what such feelings are ultimately grounded in, and what aspects of suburban living could be amplified in order to heighten or diminish the degree to which residents feel a sense of connection. This may go back to to people’s cognizance of their commonalities. With further research, we may also identify other things that feelings of connectedness depend upon.</p>

					<h3>Reflection on Methods</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-8">
					<p>While the insights we gathered from our visits to various suburbs were significant, our methodology was perhaps in need of greater consideration. The probes we deployed did not attract as much engagement as we had hoped. In some cases, our approach did not exhibit sensitivity to the area in which we were trying to collect information. For instance, in West End, many people were hesitant and/or unwilling to talk to us. This may have been due to the fact that the Make a Wish Foundation collectors were just around the corner, trying to get everyone to donate $1 a day to the foundation. As such, people may have been more cautious, and may have been prompted to question what our motives were in wanting to speak with them. In this particular location, it may have been more effective to deploy a probe that did not require any interaction with us. Likewise, simply attending community events may have ended up allowing us to learn more about the connections and disconnections people feel. (This is, of course, something we can still do.) Going forward, we should conduct our research in such a way that makes it more likely for people to share their stories (about connection) with us -- to feel comfortable sharing those stories, to feel like they have the time to share those stories, and also to feel motivated to share such stories.</p>

					<h3>Site Selection</h3>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-8">
					<p>After discussing our findings from this activity, we chose to select West End as the site which we will further explore for this project. The reason for this is because we believe that the rapid gentrification of the area (and the effects that this gentrification will have on its relatively ‘alternative’ vibe) presents the strongest opportunity for us to challenge Brisbane’s concept of and development as a (government-run, corporate) “smart city.” In particular, the location stood out to us as an interesting selection because of its notable attraction of hippies, leftists, artists, musicians, vegetarians, etc. After visiting, we found a quote on social media that further solidified our selection of the location as a site of tension created by the increasing amount of construction in the area: <i>“If the corrupt Brisbane City Council and dodgy developers didn't have their hands so deeply in each other's pockets this could have remained as the premiere and preferred place for so many amazing bands to play. So thanks a lot the pair of you two organisations for not consulting with the community, your corporate steamrolling greed and not caring about what is actually needed/wanted in West End. Bye bye Motor Room, Vision Gallery and Boundary St food markets. You were awesome!!!!”</i></p>

					<p>We consider West End to be a good selection primarily because we believe that there is some sense of “community” that already exists in the location. This isn’t to say that people don’t have feelings of disconnectedness. It’s only to say that some people at least seem to recognize that they are not alone in opposing everything that West End is slowly becoming. They may not be socially very close with many people in the area, but they can at least identify that they are “on the same team” as others who are also being negatively impacted by West End’s rapid gentrification.</i></p>
