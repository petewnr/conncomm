		<h3> SUBURBAN SITE INVESTIGATION </h3>
		<article class="col-md-8">
		
		<h4> OUR GOALS FOR THIS INVESTIGATION </h4>
		<div class="row">
			<section class="col-lg-12">
				<p>Our goal this morning was to investigate the connection people had with various suburbs and the strength of these connections.  Our intention was to uncover what was important to them and if things changed in their suburbs how would the good and bad aspects of the change impact on them.</p>
<br />
				<p>To probe for this information we created three forms of enquiry:
<br />	
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					  <li>on-line survey sent through Facebook to friends and family </li>
					  <li>A prompt on posters supplying people with hashtags to present information via various social media</li>
					  <li>Personal interview on the sidewalks of the suburbs</li>
					</ul>

				<section class="col-lg-8 col-xs-12">
				<p>For the interviews and prompts we posed three opened questions that we hoped people would openly describe their feelings and views about those questions.  The three questions were:</p>
<br />
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
					  <li>Tell us why you are here at this place now. </li>
					  <li>Tell us about your favourite place.</li>
					  <li>Tell us about your least favourite place.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				</aside>
<br />
				<p>These questions were presented on a noticeboard and the facility for people to write their comments underneath. The pictures around the question was used to grab the people’s interest without leading them to a specific direction in their answer.  Using different coloured pens the noticeboard looked more appealing and eye catching while being a bit of fun.</p>
<br />
				<p>The prompts had exactly the same approach but being more open ended to allow people to interpret the question in any way they wished.  The survey questions are presented below. </p>

				<p>The GABBA was a hive of activity because of an international cricket match between Australia and Pakistan happening today.  For most of the people we interviewed the connection to the suburb was the game – either attending the game or working at the venue. </p>
<br />
				<p>It was very difficult to get people to stop and talk because they were busy meeting up with someone, going to work or just going somewhere else (not where we were).  All moved with purpose and the personal barriers of sunglasses and earphones made it difficult to approach.  One person even pointed at his ears and the implication was “I have earphones in  . .  . are you real, you can’t talk to me”.</p>

				</aside>
				<p>The people we did talk to, who were going to the match, were excited and vibrant and happy to be there, in their social groups, and were positive about being there.  This was the place they wanted to be at this moment in time.  It was very different to where they would consider where they would like to be on a regular basis, with most people saying “it was their home that was important and their favourite place to be”.  Those places are where they do what they do – enjoy the peaceful life of the beach side township of 1770 or Texas where an accountant could go roo shooting. </p>
<br />
				<p>This strong tie to where people drew their connection or disconnection of place also seemed to be not always of a specific geographical region.  One young lady we interviewed saw that her home in bed was the most favourite place to be and she hated the crowded and busy traffic of Brisbane.  She was a north side resident dropping her brother off at the GABBA for work and was frustrated with the amount of traffic there and around the city. </p>

				<p>This strong connection to the person’s suburb was also apparent with the few local residents of the GABBA region.  They were in the GABBA doing their business (shopping and returning misaddressed post parcel) and couldn’t think of living anywhere else.  They loved living there because of the vibrant nature and the interesting characters of the suburb. </p>
<br />
				<p>These local resident tended to be older and were relaxed, less in a rush and very happy to chat. They were just as interested to know who we were and why we were there as we wanted to know about them.  For them they liked the business of the GABBA as it was developed and eclectic and had the facilities they wanted or the ability to get to them.  They would not want to be where facilities weren’t accessible -  a third world country such as Somalia.</p>

				<p>The social prompt we created we placed in two positions in well frequented areas to try and get responses on social media.  One was placed in the window of a local coffee shop “Beartown” and the other two next to a bakery. </p>
