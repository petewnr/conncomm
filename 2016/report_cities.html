							<h4>Amsterdam</h4>
							<p>Amsterdam is known for its bottom-up participatory approach to smart city planning. Smart city projects are driven by government, knowledge institutions, the private sector, and citizens. The city holds challenges and hackathons, which invite citizens to contribute their ideas for smart city projects. </p>
							<p>Amsterdam also utilizes “living labs,” communities and neighborhoods where smart city projects can be tested in a smaller scale environment, to continue the development of projects before potentially deploying them on a larger scale. Much of the testing in these living labs is focused on projects related to energy consumption. </p>
							<p>Most resources online commend Amsterdam for its “socially inclusive” approach to smart city planning, highlighting it as an example that other smart cities should follow.</p>

							<h4>Barcelona</h4>
							<p>Barcelona think itself of a city of the people, it seeks to improve citizens welfare and quality of life as well as to foster economic progress. The city takes a lead to facilitate stakeholders while allowing them to operate independently to ensure their activities meet the smart city ventures aims. Local talent is a target, and a collaboration of all people and the city council uses technology as a catalyst for the collaboration. </p>
							<p>The 100+ projects that have both physical and digital dimensions are what makes the city smart ranging from high-quality urban planning and renewal projects to historical preservation, as well as providing digital connectivity via fibre optic, wifi and sensors. </p>
							<p>Tag cloud opinions allow the people to be more involved and engaged during events by creating, sending and sharing personal content via mobile allowing people to express their ideas and know what is happening in real time throughout the city. Barcelona via a city plan stores data for people and business to use, they collect the data using various council companies, use frameworks to help display and read the data and then the data is made available to the people and can be analysed.</p>
							<p>The majority of resources for Barcelona are in spanish, however some english academic articles have been published.</p>

							<h4>Beijing</h4>
							<p>Beijing, as capital city of China, serves as one of the pilot smart cities planned by China Government in 2013. It aims to help governments and other stakeholders to identify leading technology to drive and support Smart City development as well as establish further guidelines and evaluation mechanisms. The smart city projects in Beijing are driven by several departments in government, such as Ministry of Housing and Urban ⁃ Rural Development and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Meanwhile, the government is organising alliance with national enterprises and private companies. </p>
							<p>Based on the historical background where Beijing has taken up immense migration from the past decades, the current focus of the smart city solutions in Beijing is to cope with the population issues specifically on pollution, housing affordability and traffic congestion. Pilot projects such as air purifying bus stop and mobile residents reporting system were deployed in recent years, yet none of those projects’s outcome were published. Since Beijing is still in an experiment stage of developing smart city with the capacity of large population, there are limited channel provided to enable people to engage with the development process, neither accessible resources of the developing infrastructures and sensors. People therefore in general have low awareness towards smart city development in Beijing. </p>

							<p>Geelong aims to enhance a healthy, connected community and improve its economy to become more stable and promising. The Business-Higher Education Round Table (BHERT) believes that behind every smart city is a smart campus/university. In order to achieve such goals, there will be an improvement in student-life, in terms of facilities and the upgrade of technology (primarily for navigation). As tertiary education becomes more preferred across the city, there is a potential for a recovery in business, attracting more stakeholders and opening up new opportunities for new businesses. </p>
							<p>Plans and resources are currently unavailable to the public in terms of their progress over the last year since proposing the idea, however we do know that they have partnered with large companies such as Cisco, IBM and Deakin University. </p>

							<h4>San Diego</h4>
							<p>San Diego defines it goals for a smart city by using collaborative approach to drive innovation and opportunity to make the city environmentally clean, energy conscious and a relaxed and liveable city.  The strong direction by the government to involve all people (citizens and business) has allowed everyone to take ownership of the development of this smart city - a city moving into the C21st.</p>
							<p>Having been recognized for its successes in innovation and education San Diego, through the Smart City plan, aims to provide a sustainable future for its forthcoming young innovators.  These innovators who have already developed the city to make it clean and green. The city’s commitment to be environmentally conscious has seen the innovation of electric cars and electric powering stations.  </p>
							<p>By cutting down the number of fossil fuel driven vehicles and replacing them with electric cars, San Diego has become the America’s leading city for clean transport and reducing greenhouse emissions. San diego is recognized for work for being energy conscious with the solar power being sent to the city grid by the  cruise terminal and new means to aid medical research through the Alumina Institutes work with DNA research and dementia studies.</p>
							<p>National Geographic has recognized San Diego as an innovative city that has ‘positively turned around it’s culture to be a city developed by and for it’s people’.  The development of Gaslamp region brings in people to live, eat, party and celebrate their favourite teams at world class sporting arenas. A now vibrant suburb that connects people to their favourite activities. Being a city of diverse cultures and socio-economic regions, smart city programs have been able to connect the talents and skills of the differing classes together so they work together and benefit each other and the city. </p>

							<h4>Singapore</h4>
							<p>Singapore is a thriving country, with a population of 5.6 million people and has been heralded for its outstanding economy, low unemployment rates and innovation that boosts the quality of life for the people.  The government’s biggest innovation is the Singapore Smart Nation.</p>
							<p>The Smart Nation plan aims to immerse Singapore with digital technology and to encourage its people to embrace the digitally connected global society the world has become. The implementation of solar energy is driving the city to be clean, sustainable and energy efficient. The city has been wired with technology to measure practically everything from humidity, sun exposure to pollution and wind direction in order to monitor and change the factors that affect the peoples living standards.</p>
							<p>The government has been the driver behind the regeneration and development of Singapore and by pushing a transparent open plan has enlisted the people and private enterprise in this development. Innovative projects that have been presented are the marriage between public bus lines and uber called the Beeline, the Elderly Monitoring System (EMS) - using Internet of Things technology to monitor elder people houses in order to make their life safer and sustainable. The Singapore government has provided for the future by developing their education to embrace innovation, digital technology and computational thinking. The Singapore Smart Nation plan aims to bring the city into the C21st and look to the future.</p>

							<h4>Songdo</h4>
							<p>Songdo IBD was designed by the New York Office of Kohn Pederson Fox (KPF) as ubiquitous smart city.  Using highly developed networks of technology throughout the city, every aspect of the city is monitored and data is used to make life better – traffic flow, energy use more efficient and the residents of Songdo uses technology to control every aspect of their life as well. </p>
							<p>The drivers for this city are government and private enterprise whose sole purpose is to increase the wealth and economy of the city.  The city is designed for business and the population is built on the workers who are enticed by employment opportunities.  Therefore, the Increased numbers of people working in Songdo means business growth which was the primary goal of Songdo IBD.  The focus is profit and any people looking to move there for non-business purposes are not usually catered for, and can find themselves being marginalized. </p>

							<h4>Findings</h4>
							<p>Going through the process of studying smart cities around the world has enabled us to see the ways in which different priorities lead to different outcomes that serve different people. When we design for connected communities, it is therefore important for us to consider the politics of our work. Who will it actually serve? Why are we doing it? </p>
							<p>Exploring a diverse range of smart cities has also allowed us to map the differing degrees of citizen participation to differing outcomes for the city itself. In San Diego, Amsterdam and Barcelona, residents are able to have a relatively high degree of participation in smart city planning. They have a considerable amount of involvement that directly impacts decision-making (e.g. pitching project ideas on the city’s website (Amsterdam), participating in hackathons and challenges (Amsterdam), and funding projects (San Diego)). 
</p>
							<p>While there are certainly questions that can be raised regarding the degree to which smart city planning in most cities is really participatory, it can at least be said that Amsterdam, Barcelona, and San Diego have taken a far more socially inclusive approach to smart city planning than many of their counterparts. For instance, in Songdo, residents have no ability to participate whatsoever. People seem to be “part of the furniture” and fit into the mechanisms of this technologically advanced city. The plan, which was developed by a New York-based company, has a top-down approach. The smart city’s projects are in service of businesses and profit. As such, this has been a point of criticism. There has been a noted disregard for the poor in favor of catering to the city’s wealthiest and most technologically knowledgeable population. </p>
							<p>All of these cities are considered to be “smart,” but it is the differing flavour and/or focus that creates the differences between them and all of the other cities we researched.

							<h4>Further Considerations</h4>
							<p>In making sense of the variety of smart cities we analyzed, we turned to sources that express critical perspectives on smart cities. These sources have provided insights which have motivated us to examine the political dimensions of the cities we reviewed from a critical lens. This is important because, as Söderström, Paasche, and Klauser (2014) write, “[smart city] discourse promotes a mentality where urban affairs are framed as an apolitical matter.” The authors discuss the centrality of storytelling to the framing of smart cities, highlighting the need for more progressive stories to be told. They point out that smart city planners should “[be] explicit about normative and political positioning as smartness only makes sense within a system of values and aims” (Söderström, Paasche, & Klauser, 2014). We have therefore found it worthwhile to dissect and question the values and aims that underpin the smart cities we researched. The below questions, which have been taken from reviewed publications, are the kinds of questions we have been raising (or, in some cases, should have been raising) when discussing our findings. </p>
							<br />
							<div class="panel panel-warning">
								<div class="panel-body">
						
									<p><em>“Who will enjoy these smart cities?”</em> (Datta, 2013)</p>
									<p><em>“Who will comprise these smart communities [and enjoy their] privileges?”</em> (Datta, 2013) </p>
									<p><em>"What kinds of social, environmental and spatial justice will smart cities reflect?”</em> (Datta, 2013)</p>
									<p><em>“Will smart cities improve the lives of those on the social, political, environmental and legal margins of the city? Or does [their] success as a concept and practice rely precisely on the elimination of those on the margins?”</em> (Datta, 2013)</p>
									<p><em>“[Are residents] happy with their life?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
									<p><em>“Do they have a good relationship with their neighbours and community in their smart city?”</em> (Hollands, 2014) </p>
									<p><em>“Do they enjoy the work they are transported to in their electric pod?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
									<p><em>“What free cultural and social amenities are provided by the city they live in?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
									<p><em>“Do they have a good standard of living and do they, more importantly, live in a fair city?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
									<p>And, from a higher level perspective:</p>
									<p><em>“Why are most cities unequal places?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
									<p><em>“What economic system created the current ecological conditions?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
									<p><em>“How can cities organically develop and real communities form?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
									<p><em>“What is the good or fair city?”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						
							<br />
							<p>Asking questions like this prompted us to discuss how we believe “smartness” should be defined. It also allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which some of the projects we reviewed (of the smart cities we researched) were, in ways we may have not initially understood, political. Hollands (2014) highlights the importance of recognizing the political context in which smart city projects are embedded, and articulating the political nature of the work such projects do:</p>
							<p><em>“For too long, smart city discourses have been ignorant as to how cities actually work sociologically and politically, and the fact that they are made up of a complex and diverse set of dynamics and conflicts… We need better sociopolitical understandings of the city and more novel approaches emphasising the need to see urban technological transformation within a wider social, political, economic, cultural and organisational context. And we need to engage very much with real-time citizen-led smart initiatives and cases studies, looking critically and carefully at the policy process, driving forces, power and sociological context.”</em> (Hollands, 2014)</p>
							<p>Identifying the main “drivers” of each smart city we reviewed helped us to better understand how smart city projects within those cities operate at a political level.</p>

							<h4>Forward Direction</h4>
							<p>In going forward with our own project, it is crucial to consider not only who the system we build will serve, but how we might involve these people in the design of the system. Currently, smart city planning in Brisbane is not very participatory at all. Most decisions are made by a select group of people. The most recent public event relating to smart city planning was CityHack. The event was sponsored by AECOM, a multinational engineering firm. It targeted people with/pursuing degrees (especially those with coding skills), and was very much about innovative startup ideas. The winning concepts echoed Brisbane’s (read: the government’s and corporations’) goals as a smart city (attracting tourism, being an innovation hub, etc.). They did not tackle wicked problems, or attempt to ameliorate systemic social issues. In designing for connected communities and selecting which community we seek to serve or create (through our design), we may also wish to challenge Brisbane’s current development as a smart city (and its concept of “smartness”).</p>
						<br />
						<hr />
						<br />
							<h4>Design Relevance</h4>
							<p>Reviewing existing smart cities enabled us to ask: what is “smart” about smart cities? As Hollands (2008) states, the “smart city” label itself may in fact “partial[ly] imped[e]” “progressive urban change,” as this (“self-congratulatory” and “self-promotional”) label has come to connote a commitment to entrepreneurialism. This was definitely highlighted in some of the cities we reviewed, where the “smart” technology only perpetuated inequalities. In terms of designing for connected communities, this activity has prompted us to think about who we want to connect, and how the “connection” our system affords can challenge the current smart city discourse and possibly contribute to a more progressive redefinition of the term “smart.”  </p>
