				<h1>Eight Mile Plains</h1>
			<section>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>Today's Eight Mile Plains is a result of housing deveopment with nearby facilities and easy access to both public transport and the M1 and M3 motorways. During my research into the suburb, I wondered how the suburb was developed and what communities were built there. I discovered that numberous structures were present in Eight Mile Plains before the housing development project, did these structure influence the type of people that moved there?</p>

				<h3>Eight Mile Plains Today</h3>
				<p>The Eight Mile Plains of today looks to be a quiet and wealthy housing estate, with fresh cut grass and beautiful houses.
				At closer inspection of the people that live there, it becomes apparent there is a certain amount of cultural diversity in the area.</p>

				<h3>Before & After</h3>
				<p>As you can see by the images, Eight Mile Plains was a very different place during 2007.
					It has gone from a fairly empty area to a hub of living people, boasting an above average rate of diversity.</p>
				<p>	Accoring to the 2011 census 48% of people living in Eight Mile Plains were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were China 7.5%, Republic of Korea 5.9%, Taiwan 4.3%, New Zealand 4.1%, India 3.7%. --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Mile_Plains,_Queensland">Wiki</a> </p>

				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<p>As is apparent from the photos, a decent section of Eight Mile Plains was designed and developed through real estate, but they
					cannot directly influence the dempgraphic of people that moved there. There are signs that the exact same people
					who moved to Eight Mile Plains, also have nearby respective religious structures that predate the deveopment.<p/>
					<p>I also noticed a lot of similarities between Eight Mile Plains and Songdo IBD, with there being a design for development that was determined before construction, with very little occupying the area prior to completion. West End by comparison is very interesting in terms of tension, as there is an existing community and culture that is seemingly being driven out from that area due to development. In all cases that I have researched when it comes to urban development, money and profit is always a resource and goal. This approach, while seemingly economically sound, can really have unintended side effects on the existing population. </p>
					<p>The one thing I noticed about Eight Mile Plains, is that a major development process was undertaken without any abolishment of existing religious structures. This approach may have had a positive effect on enticing people moving in. When considering what to develop in the next stage of this course, I will keep this principle in mind and try not to disrupt any existing implementations, but instead attempt to incorporate it into the design.</p>
