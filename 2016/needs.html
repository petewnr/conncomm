							<h4>The makeup and history of West End</h4>
							<p>West End was one of the oldest suburb in Brisbane, its name came from the historical resemblance of the area to the London West End. While West End has been struggling to keep its bohemian heritage and multiculturalism alive even though the community has been bombarded by rapid development in the area. The community is still going strong, it was home to large Greek, Indigenous, Vietnamese and significant amount of Chinese and Italian. Majority of West End residents today made up of people who were born in Australia, this might be the umpteenth generation of non indigenous people who resides in West End since the early days of West End. West End is also known for its bohemian lifestyle, since the early 1960s the area has attracted artist and students alike. </p>

							<h4>What matters to our Target Audience</h4>
							<p>West End has roots, and people who lived there were planted in the immersive experience the community brings. With their strong sense of community people of West End has been able to march forward against the gentrification of its area. Being a community with a strong sense of connection both to their peer and their heritage is important to them. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Community</li>
								<li>Being heard</li>
								<li>Keeping the suburbs vibe</li>
								<li>Preserve the heritage and culture</li>

							<h4>What matters to key stakeholders</h4>
							<p>The key stakeholders would be people affected by the gentrification of the area, these people are the main residents of West End. They are people who wants to heard, it seems like they could benefit from a clear two way communications and transparency in the area development plan. While on the other hand, since West End is an inner suburbs area the Brisbane City Council would be another key stakeholders, having an inner suburbs with deeply rooted heritage that also have a high standard of living seems to matter a lot to the council.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Clarity and transparency on development plan</li>
								<li>To be heard by the council and the developer</li>
								<li>Shop owners - construct a commercial area</li>
								<li>Brisbane City Council - develop the place with high standard of liveability </li>

							<h4>Describe the evidence indicating whether the problem/goal should be a priority issue.
</h4>
							<p>A few evidence we got came from our observations, interviews and online research. Observing the area it will be obvious to people that West End is a very lively neighborhood with a spice of street arts and lots of multicultural shops in the area, when we look more into the details we can notice the sense of community in the neighborhood and there are some street markings saying “Resist, Revive, Decolonize”. For people who are familiar with the area it won’t come as a surprise that the people of West End would go to such extend to state they want to be heard, that something is trying to subdue the community and colonizing it. </p>
							<p>While on the other hand an interview with a backpacker and a former resident shown how much impact the construction makes to the people in the area, one of the interviewee moved out because of the construction but she still frequent the area, she briefly mentions to avoid several developed area and it seems her bias towards the development is strong.</p>
							<p>The last evidence is a strong comment on the motor room facebook page. The motor room was located in the Boundary street market, since after April the Boundary street market has to close down and relocate because of development in their current land. Lot’s of outrage and effort put by the people to make the developer stop, but it didn’t bear any fruit. The comment as quoted was, “If the corrupt Brisbane City Council and dodgy developers didn't have their hands so deeply in each other's pockets this could have remained as the premiere and preferred place for so many amazing bands to play. So thanks a lot the pair of you two organisations for not consulting with the community, your corporate steamrolling greed and not caring about what is actually needed/wanted in West End. Bye bye Motor Room, Vision Gallery and Boundary St food markets. You were awesome!!!!”</p>

							<h4>Going forward</h4>
							<p>We need to spend more time in the community and find activities they will have, that we can attend or create a social function. We also need to talk to people in the surrounding suburbs that might get affected by the development of West End. </p>
							<p>Looking at it from different angles, we also need to find out from both the opposing party and the agreeing party of the development.</p>
