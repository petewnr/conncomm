							<h4>Initial Insights</h4>
							<p>To truly understand the community of West End we need to get to know the people and delve into the what are their needs from the community.  What creates their identity and makes the community strong and connected.  By getting out into the community, experiencing what they do and making conversation with the people who are important in the community, we intend to gain a better insight of all the stakeholders of the community - West End.</p>
							<p>Alongside this research, we need to find their dislikes of the suburb and what causes a threat to the community.  There are many different factors to the community and all have a different say and ownership of the suburb.  The government has an overriding control of what happens in the suburb and it is this imbalance of power the government has that causes tension and a divide between the stakeholders of the suburb.</p>
							<p>To drive our project forward we want to gain an overview of the culture of the community. To get this insight to the community we are going to conduct face to face discussions with various groups that are running within the community - WECA (West End Community Association), The Greek and Vietnamese communities and the organisation committee running the Latin Communities festival.</p>
							<p>The people are most important in our research and the focus point of any project we make must be about the people and gaining their voice.  To do this we are going to provide various probes that will allow the giving of their point of view without feeling threatened or pressured. Some probes we are going to present are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Comment wall being presented at the markets</li>
								<li>Cameras to pictorially show how they feel or show their point of view</li>
								<li>Diary studies</li>
								<li>An interactive cultural probe</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We have used social media to gain a personal perspective of views.  Placing social prompts on noticeboards will allow people to leave comments on twitter by use of a hashtag.  We have created a facebook page for our project and built links to various interests of West End. We are looking for people’s thoughts and we can pose probing questions that can be give us direction. </p> 
							<p>It is important to get views from various sides.  As government/council are seen as an instigator of tension and stakeholder who holds considerable power it is important to gain an understanding of their directions and participation as part of this community.  Are they keeping a sense of community and also taking in points about the wider city or is there motivation just as most people speculate as ‘one hand feeding the coffers of others without consideration of the people. </p>
							<p>In designing a project it is essential to consider those communities that aren’t being considered in the current Brisbane Smart City plan - a plan is heavily biased toward entrepreneurship, large business organisation and innovation.  The idea that injecting a city with innovation and advanced digital technology is going to fix up problems and be an advantage for all stakeholders of the city is flawed with misunderstanding.  Many of the population isn’t concerned with high levels of technology and don’t find this as part of their lifestyle.  As we have seen in West End the development happening at present are causing tension and the design we build must cater for communities that are being marginalised.</p>

							<h4>Designing for Resistance</h4>
							<p>From what we gathered from chatting to some people in West End, one aspect that is quite important for a population of people in the area is resisting planners’ decisions. Members of this population often show up to protest construction projects. Vanolo (2013) discusses how smart cities may “reduce political conflict, insurgence, radicalism and resistance” by governing the behaviors of their “smart citizens.” From this perspective, the deployment of smart technology can be seen as a mechanism of social control that acts to “discipline” those living within the city. This begs the question: what would smart city technology look like if it was in service of radicals looking to resist? What if smart city technology was adversarial? (DiSalvo, 2012) This is just one potential direction we could take the project in. </p>

							<h4>Where to look for inspiration</h4>
							<br />
							<h6>A Social Justice Orientation</h6>
							<p>Dombrowski, Harmon, and Fox (2016) discuss the ways in which design that deals with large-scale social issues may benefit from a “social justice orientation.” The authors articulate various design strategies and commitments that could aid our thinking with this project. The design strategies address designing for the following categories:</p>
							<br />
							<p><strong>Transformation</strong> - “suggests the usefulness of a long-term approach to designing for the evolving, emergent social, economic, and political relations that produce inequalities” | “draws our temporal orientation from immediate innovation towards a focus on the role that structural inequalities (e.g., government institutions, the cultural milieu, access to education) may play in perpetuating social injustices”</p>
							<p><strong>Recognition</strong> - “focuses on identifying unjust practices, policies, laws, and other phenomena, as well as identifying those people who are most negatively impacted by such phenomenon” | “can happen when designers articulate and frame a problem and its collection of key issues”</p>
							<p><strong>Reciprocity</strong> - “describes the relationship between those who are owed justice and what needs to occur for the obligations of justice to be fulfilled” | “focuses on engendering more fully equitable relationships”</p>
							<p><strong>Enablement</strong> - “facilitating and developing opportunities for people to fulfill their potential and to develop their own capacity” | “has a multi-level focus on developing opportunities for change, including scaffolding individual behavior change as well as the practices and policies related to fostering structural change”
	Distribution - “equitable distribution of the benefits and burdens of social systems”</p>
							<p><strong>Accountability</strong> - “includes holding responsible those who foster or unduly benefit from the oppression of others and identifying and assigning appropriate sanctions, penalties, or even punishments” Reference: Dombrowski, Harmon, and Fox (2016)</p>
							<p>In designing for those who are or will be negatively impacted by the gentrification of West End, a social justice orientation (involving consideration of the strategies outlined by Dombrowski, Harmon, and Fox (2016) for the above categories) can enable us to be more attentive to the complex political dimensions that our work will be situated within. The strategies for the above categories can guide us within our design process and inspire us to look deeper into existing inequalities and/or oppressions.</p>
		
							<p>In designing for resistance, through an interpretation based in Dombrowski, Harmon, and Fox’s (2016) proposals, we may come to understand “participation” as an insufficient mechanism for supporting resistance when “[a smart city planner, government, or corporation] is often in the primary position of control.” The authors point to a need to “reconfigure the constellations of power” (Dombrowski, Harmon, Fox, 2016). From this lens, a system that merely communicates the desires of the people is not enough to produce progressive social change (when the people themselves ultimately do not have the power to make the final decision). This raises questions of how we may appropriately design a system that not only “gives people a voice” but effectively ensures (or at least makes it more likely that) their voice will be heard. (Or, better yet, simultaneously transforms them into the “hearers” who ultimately have the power to approve or disapprove of proposals.)</p>
							<br />

							<h6>Existing Projects</h6>
							<br />
							<p>Hollands (2014) examines “a range of more modest and small-scale sociotechnological interventions that contrast with that of the corporate smart city and which might begin to help us envisage a different way of thinking about and ‘doing’ smartness.” We can look to these projects for inspiration, as they are all examples of a commitment to people (not corporations) and this is something that we hope our own system will demonstrate.</p>
							<p><strong>Brickstarter</strong> - “The general philosophy behind this new initiative is to utilise social media to be more responsive, representative and educative in transforming grass roots urban proposals into viable projects (what they call YIMBY— yes in my backyard)... Their prototype IT platform invites and advises groups how to negotiate their way through what Brickstarter calls the ‘dark matter’ of local city planning and more important how they might be able to fund such a project, through a kind of urban crowd-funding/sourcing platform.”</p>
							<p><strong>Low Impact Living Affordable Community (LILAC)</strong> - “the UK’s first Mutual Home Ownership Scheme” | “Community-wise, LILAC has been designed with communal values in mind with a common area with shared kitchen, laundry, workshop, meeting/function room, as well as each unit have their own allotments to grow food. While the project no doubt waded through a lot of local authority ‘red tape’ to get the project off the ground, it is an excellent example of a grassroots initiative, where people not corporations or politicians control their urban lives, and is a potential model for providing affordable and sustainable housing in other areas of the UK.”</p>
							<p><strong>Face Your World</strong> - “Set-up by two artists, [Face Your World was a project] which invited young people and neighbours living in an Amsterdam neighbourhood to collaborate in producing an virtual vision of their local park, which they used to persuade the local government to adopt in place of their own plan.”</p>
							<p><strong>569 Acres</strong> - “[569 Acres was] designed to turn Brooklyn’s 596 acres of public owned land into common use by a range of community groups and individuals. Its IT online platform, effectively a ‘knowledge commons,’ has been crucial in building this intervention, connecting people to each other, matching skills and sharing experience and information about how to transform vacant lots into sustainable growing plots.”
		Reference: Hollands (2014)</p>
							<br />
							<p>Projects like these are especially important when so many alternative political groups (e.g. environmentalists, squatters, etc.) and movements (e.g. “reclaim the streets”) are still considered to be a nuisance in many cities (Hollands, 2000) when their perspectives and agendas could actually be used as a resource for progressive urban change. </p>

							<h4>Going Forward</h4>
							<p>Conducting more research with people in West End will enable us to better problematize what our project might address. Continuously interpreting our work from a perspective informed by critical commentaries on smart cities can allow us to raise appropriate questions regarding who our system truly serves and to what extent it actually serves them. </p>
