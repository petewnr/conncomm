					<h3>West End</h3>

				<section class="col-lg-8">
					<p>In West End, we attempted to explore the extent to which people felt connected to others in the area. This was done through a map activity as well as a semi-structured interview. Although we only ended up finding two people to chat with us, we were able to gather that there is a lot of tension between a specific population of people in West End (especially those who might be labelled as “hippies”) and the people who are developing West End. This development can in some ways be seen as an attack on the existing culture in the area. This said, in some ways the continuing gentrification of West End can also been seen as something that brings people together -- in protest, in the maintenance of a counterculture, etc. While the people upset by the gentrification of this area don’t have the power to necessarily stop construction projects and prevent West End from becoming what it will likely become, many at least find value in collectively organizing.</p>

				<section class="col-lg-8">
					<p>The people of Woolloongabba were a mix of people in celebratory mode and the locals about doing their business.  It was a buzz of anticipation for the first cricket test between Australia and Pakistan. Many people wandering the streets, filling the cafes, and parking illegally as they drop people off and holding up the flow of the traffic.</p>
 
					<p>All this hype and excitement is what some people liked about the suburb and on a regular basis there was a sense of comradery in the suburb.  This feeling was generating by people who were visitors and not locals. </p>
 
					<p>The locals had a negative feeling to the day and saw the crowds, noise, congestion, rubbish and foul behavior as a massive intrusion to their suburb.  A community they live in 365 days of the year and then in short spirts of a few days at a time is invaded and abused. This all has arisen by the development of the GABBA and the surrounding are to support and provide for anyone other than the local community.</p>

					<h3>Camp Hill</h3>

			</div>
			
			<div class="row">
				<section class="col-lg-8">
					<p>The people in this community loved the quieter and relaxed nature and hated the hustle and bustle of the CBD.  Accepting that they had to travel to the CBD and surrounding suburbs to work they were appreciative they had good transport facilities to get them there and home again but it was always important to them that it was the quiet nature of the community that was home.</p>
 
					<p>Tension was also apparent in the community but as in most of our research it concerned the communication line to and with government.  As a smart city with a focus on business many small businesses within the community were concerned about the lack of respect they have for small business.</p>
