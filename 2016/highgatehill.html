				<h3>For Thoughts</h3>
				<p>Highgate Hill is a highly desirable suburbs, the suburbs looked almost sureal like it's taken out from a movie.
				Looked very utopic from the outside, but are the inhabitants really happy on the inside? Is the utopian look only a superficial cover
			for the distopic truth behind the elevated suburb? </p>
				<h3>Basic Information</h3>
				<p>Population of Highgate Hill were estimated to break 6 thousand people in the year 2016, while the data is not available yet it shows a strong trend of population increase since 2001-2006. <br>

the top two population of highgate Hills are Independent youth and maturing & established independence people, while almost 30% of the populations are families. [survey by realestate.com.au] <br>

					<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"> With a good maintained facilities and infrastructure, a park positioned on top of a hill. Highgate Hill is very desirable, but are these developments aimed towards the resident? Or it's devised as a marketing ploy to make the place a desirable living area.
					Highgate Hills main road are equipped with bike lane, meanwhile the number of bike commuter in the area is not the highest, car ownership is quite high with more than half the household populations owns at least one car and more than 150 household has more than three cars, which makes cars the number one method of transportation by the population to commute.
					Aging populations are noticable during a certain time of the day, I found a nursing home in the area as well.

					<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"> A noticeable visual if you take a stroll down the Dornoch Terrace is a tall standing dark modern looking appartment building, one of the newest development in the area simply called The Highgate Residence. Meanwhile when you walk towards the Highgate Park and take a turn into Hampstead Rd, you'll find a mixed housing both maintained old queenslander and the more modern brick houses.
						And if you took another turn onto one of the street you'll notice lots of well mantained old houses. Some of these houses has gone through noticable modernization, easily noticed solar panels on the roof top.
						Some old properties seemingly to be unmantained has been put for a new property development, it seems like the modernization of the suburb has moved towards the center not only on the mainroad.

					<p>Looking from the outside, there are lots of reason why the suburb is so desirable the fact that it's part of the inner
					suburb, good view, convenience supported by local businesses, public facilities and the fact that it's still developing to accomodate
				more people into the suburb.</p>

				<div class="col-xs-12">
					<h3> Discussion </h3>
					<p>The suburb looks really great and that's what I found discomforting, I found the desirability of the suburb worrying. What drives the improvements of the suburb?
					Does the redevelopment and modernization of the suburb goes in hand with the improvements, or does it come as the result of the improvement? Does the improvement a result of the development?
					These poses different sets of problem, if the redevelopment of the suburb is a result of the improvement done by the community, how would the community feels about it? I think I need to do further observation and talk to people
				in the area about what's happening.</p>
