		<p>This pictorial seeks to provoke reflection on the idea that the only social spaces are spaces of consumerism. This is highlighted through the incorporation of photos taken in Toowong, a suburb of Brisbane. It should be noted that this pictorial adopts a definition of sociality that encompasses physical sociality only (and purposefully excludes digital sociality).</p>

		<h2>Discussion</h2>
		<p>With the above pictures, I aim to illustrate how Toowong's social spaces are spaces of consumerism. I do not intend to propose that spaces of consumerism are necessarily social spaces (e.g. the construction worker ate his purchased food alone in the shopping center; near the two people chatting over morning coffee was an individual having coffee alone, reading the newspaper), nor do I attempt to posit that the capitalist structuring of our society is what ultimately allows people to have social lives (e.g. consider alternatively structured intentional communities, and how these spaces can be social). I only wish to highlight the ways in which the capitalist structuring of our society centers sociality around the act of consumerism. While I don't necessarily have the best pictures to communicate this perspective, it was a perspective that was most evident to me during my own observation of the area in which I realized that the only people I found chatting were doing so over food at a cafe or while shopping. In terms of the project we are doing in this course, this perspective is relevant because it highlights the lack of opportunities for non-consumerism-based connection. In this sense, I hope that these images can inspire us to think about the ways in which design can bring city inhabitants together in ways that don't necessitate acts of consumerism.</p>
