							<h4>Annerley</h4>
							<p>Annerley is a suburb located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south of the Brisbane CBD with medium population density with many apartment blocks, guest houses and fast-food outlets. Overall, the suburb is filled with openness and inviting atmosphere through looking into how the houses are set and responded to neighbourhood. It is noticeable that Brisbane City Council puts effort in building the public facility while remain some existing places old and under maintainance. In the contrast, the communities of this suburb have been voluntarily taken care of the places where the Council may have neglected.  The collaboration of open space between communities and government provides consideration to our project that whether negative aspects such as lack of maintenance of a space by government actually prompt people and local community to contribute to connections around the space. </p>

							<h4>Eight Mile Plains</h4>
							<p>Today's Eight Mile Plains is a result of housing development with nearby facilities and easy access to both public transport and the M1 and M3 motorways. Although the real estate development is increasing in the area with various of promotional signs to attract people, there is not direct influence to the demographic of people that moved there. However, there is a noticeable correlation between the existed nearby respective religious structures with the demographic of the people who had moved in. This finding contribute to our future design direction that the existing cultural implementation may serve as one of the factors of influencing the connection among communities. </p>

							<h4>Fairfield</h4>
							<p>Fairfield is another residential suburb at south of the Brisbane CBD and by the Brisbane river. There are parks and open spaces with poles and fences that only allow pedestrians to use. Moreover, there is an inhospitable divide sitting between the immaculate park and shopping centre, which may have inhibited people’s usage of the recreational area. In this case, the pre-made walking path don’t really invite people to do outdoor activities. It is indicated that walking is the main movement in the suburb since there are a lot of worn down walking traces in the inner streets that are not pre-designed. It is interesting to know that people with certain objectives (e.g. walking and outdoor activities) created their own tailored access and pathway. In terms of our project, this finding provides us an option of motivating people to connect with others despite of the lack of invitation from limited infrastructure. </p>

							<h4>Hemmant</h4>
							<p>Hemmant is an older rural suburb of Brisbane that had a divide run through the centre – a railway line and major motorway.  This was a government decision to build a connection between the city and the bayside suburbs.  The thoughts of the divide have it initially creating a disconnection within this community as there has developed a very distinctive difference between the northern side which is mainly industrial and the southern which remains rural and residential. </p>
							<p>The divide really works to connect the two parts of the community and the placement of a small store is a major catalyst in the drawing together the different people in this community.  Even though people cross it to get to work or go home or use the train line to come to work or leave to go to work in another suburb there is the ability of people to connect with each other and make conversations get to know each other.  The store owner would get to know the regulars who stop to get their breakfast coffee or lunch on their way to work and the resident dashing into the store to get the newspaper and rushing to the train.  </p>
							<p>The divide is bringing back a sense of community, although changed, to a community that has had its school and church closed down.  Major landmarks that could have rung the death knell for the Hemmant.</p>

							<h4>Highgate Hill</h4>
							<p>Highgate Hill is a well developed suburb with well maintained, modernised accommodations where many rundown houses are being pushed for redevelopment at the same time. The main commercial industries in the suburb are a milk bar, cafe and pet shop. The park at the top of the hill brings people together with spectacle events. </p>
							<p>It is worth noting that the rapid development provides only few places for people to congregate, which presents lack of sense of community and people try to reach elsewhere such as West End and Buranda for community, facilities and shops. </p>
							<p>This finding indicate that a place with strong connection may not be related to high standard of liveability, it could be a results from accessibility of commercial and recreational area.  </p>

							<h4>Toowong</h4>
							<p>Toowong is known for Toowong Village, one of Brisbane’s largest shopping centers. Surrounding the shopping center are apartment buildings and houses. The area is generally busy with many people passing through on their transit route. </p>
							<p>The main takeaway from from conducting a site survey at this location was the finding that the only social spaces were spaces of consumerism. In terms of designing for connected communities, this finding is significant because it highlights the lack of opportunities for non-consumerism-based connection. Consideration of this may inspire us to think about the ways in which design can bring city inhabitants together in ways that don’t necessitate acts of consumerism.</p>

							<h4>Reflection on Findings</h4>
							<p>Based on our research into these six areas, we were able to identify what it is that defined each suburb. In Annerley, it was a collaboration of open space, where the area is currently being maintained and decorated by a local charity group with allowance of the local community. In Eight Mile Plains, it is based around cultural influence, a suburb where people of different backgrounds reside in other words multicultural, all through the effect of having certain establishments that the people can belong to, such as churches. On the other hand, Hemmant and Fairfield showed a division, which may have led to a tailored invitation or disconnections among the space. Toowong also shows some kind of division but more towards the social connection within a consumerism and non-consumerism based environment. When it comes to a division within an area, it poses a question of whether or not it is a disconnection, could it be the community’s form of connection? Meanwhile, Highgate Hill seemed a little too perfect and opportunistic, for non-residents to visit the suburb, it may come across as a comfortable and convenient area to reside in, however, for residents, the biggest problem is when it comes to shopping. The nearest supermarket and any kind of shopping area that can be found is in West End, that way there is not much sense of a connection within the suburb because everyone is generally off in different directions doing their own things.</p>
							<p>In doing these suburban surveys, we were able to grasp a better understanding of how each suburb differs from one another. Through observation, several potential communities were identified and whether or not it assists in the connection within the communities were not clear. If we were to research further into the suburb to gain more of a knowledge we could get a better understanding of the happenings within the area and its sense of community. To accomplish this we would need to conduct a people survey where several citizens are asked about the area.</p>

							<h4>Reflection on Methods</h4>
							<p>Coming into the site survey, many of us did not have too much of an idea of what we were really looking for. We intended to find out what was happening in that suburb and keep our focus as open as possible. We came up with several categories as reference in order to make sure we would cover enough: movement, people and public realm, sensations, place, space, events, attitude, misuse, time and spatial justice. </p>
							<p>Many pictures were taken based on what we thought were interesting, abnormal and social. It was only after taking a few photos were we then able to identify a trend or what helped define the area in relation to the community, whether it was connected or disconnected. </p>
							<p>After we identified the provocative trend and themes, we did secondary research online to further investigate and justify the information that we gathered and tried to keep it objective based on the secondary information such as demographic and history of the site. The site was surveyed through observing the space, community/people and concluding with the trends found in each suburb in terms of the connection people had between each other, the area and whether the infrastructure had an impact on the social connection of people.</p>
							<p>When it comes to limitation, most of us think that we could have spent more time in the site and watch people interact with each other so that we could draw the connections and disconnections more precisely. We may have missed some mundane elements in the space because we thought they were same and general in every suburb, which may have posed bias to the findings that we drew upon. </p>
							<p>Some of our sites were initially reflected in negative ways with only disconnections whereas some were being too optimistic without any disconnections. Some atmospheres may only be discovered if we stayed earlier or longer in the sites - how people commute for work and study, where would people go for shopping and dining, how would people spend their leisure time after working hours etc. </p>

							<h4>Design Opportunities</h4>
							<p>With these site surveys in mind, design opportunities arise, with the aim to improve the connectivity in the community, which in some way will be a step up to becoming a smart city. One major takeaway is that most of the connections that we’ve found are not reflected from technological modernization, instead they are the result of people’s perception towards the cultural and environmental aspects of their surroundings. This deepens the scope of our project - when talking about connections we will not only refer to the connections among people, but the relationship between people and the physical environment in the space, what are the tangible and intangible factors contribute to this kind of connections.</p>
							<p>Having this view in mind, we will be able to look into more grounded issues within the site that we will investigate in our next design stage. Another takeaway is that the connections and activity appeared most frequently and massively when they are related to business capitalisation of needs, or individuals’ objectives (most likely are consumption and well being). Connections also arise where there are limited facilities or lack of communication between people and government in the space, which indicates some other opportunities to build up connections. In the next stage of our design, it will be worth exploring specific ways to engage with people with utilising the existing implementation of facilities or infrastructure other than the identified elements. </p>
