					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>According to the smartnation.sg a website dedicated to Singapore
						smart city development, "smartness" is not a measure of how advanced
						or complex the technology being adopted, but rather on how well the
						inhabitants uses technology to address existential challenges.
						The tiny nationâ€™s effort in improving the life of its inhabitants
						includes the effort of installing myriads of sensors and surveillance
						camera in every corner, while it concerns privacy issues to the inhabitants
						the implementation of these surveillance and sensors has been fruitful.</p>
						<p>Singapore's effort in turning into a smart nation revolves around three ideals,</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Creating more opportunity for innovation</li>
							<li>Building a strong community</li>
							<li>Improving the life of it's citizen</li>
						</ul>
						<p>One of the foundation for them to achive all that is to build a connected city, which in their term it means internet and data connection.</p>
						<h3>The Driver</h3>
						<p>The Singapore government make it very clear that they're the main driver of the smart city development.
						The main smart nation office is located in the same building as the prime minister's office, which shows how
					big the government's involvement in the development. While the smart nation office take care of the project planning
				there are smaller government institutions that handles the more specific task.</p>
					<h3>Who are they prioritizing?</h3>
					<p>While they stated it quite clearly that their priority is their citizen, it is also quite
					apparent that profit is another priority. While they have 4 major initiatives which includes
				Health, Living, Mobility and Services their main tool would be their open data portal and their ability
			to generate huge amount of data.</p>
					<p>The initiatives encourage people to use technology no matter how simple or complex it is to solve
						the city's problem. They emphasize on co-creation between the people, the industry and the government to create
					new innovative opportunity.</p>
						<p>They target aging population, early aged population and population in the labour force,
						these are shown through their effort of encouraging aged living,
						improving education by teaching computational thinking to children, making commute more comfortable and efficient and
						incubating entrepreneurship.</p>
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<p>They want to make it clear that the motivations to undertake such big and expensive project (S$ 9 billion for 5 year plan) is to improve
						life of its inhabitants. But looking into the subtext on their emphasize on co-creation and innovative opportunities especially with the new technology
					area they developed specifically for startup hubs and technology experimentation I think one of their motivation would be profit based or business related.
					The new area called One North was developed by the Singaporean government, but they don't close the opportunity for private sector to chip-in into the development.
				</p>
					<h3>Example Project</h3>
					<h4>Beeline</h4>
					<p>Beeline uses Singapore's traffic data to analyze people's commute, that way
					the app can determine which route that commuter prefers and what the customer needs. Furthermore
					it allows its customer to suggest more route. The service is a middle point of the convenient
					of taxis and the price of public buses.
					</p>

					<p>Beeline works similar to uber, user's are asked to book a ride before hand, the difference
						would be that the ride is communal using a mini-bus. Beeline will go through routes to pick users up
						and drop people at the closes spot to their destination.
					</p>
					<h4>SingStat App</h4>
					<p>SingStat App is an app created by one of the government body who processes datas gathered. The purpose of the app is
					to show people the popularity of datasets based on usage and search.</p>
					<h3>Future Plans</h3>
					<p>By easing the access to their open data & increasing the connectivity to that data the state government
						are open to solutions which in this matter are supported by their effort in nurturing a culture
						of experimentation and sustaining innovation. This and also the term of encouraging co-creation, Singapore wants
					to get their citizens and private sectors to be involved in the city development.</p>
						<p>Furthermore from their four main pillars in the city development it is apparent that the government knows which
							way they want to go and what needs to be improved to achieve the correct balance of life quality in the city.
							Their open invitation to the people are a mean to find what could be done and how they could do it, also it might
							unearth many underlying problems.</p>
					<h3>Who engages with the city?</h3>
					<p>It seems like they make everyone engage with the city, from early childhood through several programs
						they run for students to be comfortable with coding and computational thinking to
						their productive population through their daily activities providing passive engagment to the data pool
						judging how they concentrate on gathering data through the use of sensors and cameras
						throughout the city, to the aging population.</p>
					<h3>Who got involved and to what extend?</h3>
					<p>Not only through passive involvement, the government also encourage everyone to be involved in the city development.
						Using open data and the frequency of events like hackathon promoting creative usage of the database. The government also
					have a fellowship program for people who have ideas and interests in developing Singapore to be a smart city.</p>
					<h3>Before & After</h3>
					<p>I haven't been able to find any written comparison on Singapore's state before
					and after condition since the launch of the smart nation program. Some interesting
					insight I found is how people joke about the government knowing everything
					about them up to when they need to do their groceries, in the comment section of
					an article by the Wallstreet Journal.</p>
					<h3>Criticism</h3>
					<p>Aside from the privacy issue there seems to be not much criticism
					can be found on the city development towards a smart city.
					There are no critics available on the smart nation initiatives, browsing through news portal, reddit and some social media
					there are no outcry on Singapore's recent technological development.
					Personally I think they want to clarify their stance on making life for the citizen better, but it doesn't seem like they have a priority list
					on the sector they want to focus on. But then with a S$ 9 billion budget for a five year plan I guess they don't have a problem funding wide array of projects.
